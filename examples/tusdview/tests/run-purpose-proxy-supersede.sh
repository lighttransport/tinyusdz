# `proxy` and `render` are ALTERNATIVES in USD, not two things to draw: a proxy
# is a cheap stand-in for a render subtree. Drawing both puts the stand-in on
# top of the geometry it stands in for -- in intent-vfx's simpleAsset a proxy
# Cube (size 2) exactly encloses the render Sphere (radius 1) and hid it
# completely.
#
# This asset reproduces that layout (purpose authored on Scopes, as real assets
# do). Both loaders must draw ONLY the render sphere. The proxy-only variant
# below pins the other half of the rule: with no render geometry to supersede
# it, the proxy still draws -- which is the whole point of authoring one.
