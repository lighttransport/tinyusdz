# the optional `ids` array exists. Index-only matching incorrectly keeps all four
# instances below visible because invisibleIds=[30] and inactiveIds=[40] do not
# equal any array index. The correct result emits two instances. The second
# scene repeats the same visibility setup in a nested PointInstancer under an
# outer prototype, covering tusdview's recursive instancer expansion.
