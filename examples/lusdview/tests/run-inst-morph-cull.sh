# Regression test: a GPU-morphed instanced PointInstancer prototype must NOT be
# wrongly frustum-culled. The morph instance's REST-pose box is off-screen but
# its morphed geometry is in view; per-instance culling pads protoAabb by the
# morph displacement (DrawMeshCPU::morphExtent) so the instance survives.
#
# Asserts the render stats report all 4 instances visible. Without the morph
# protoAabb pad the morph instance culls and this drops to 3/4 -> test fails.
#
# Needs a GL (or VK) context: runs under xvfb-run when no $DISPLAY. Software GL
# (llvmpipe) is fine -- culling is CPU-side, independent of rasterization. If no
# renderer can be created the test SKIPs (exit 77, ctest SKIP_RETURN_CODE) rather
# than failing, so headless CI without a GPU/display does not report a failure.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = fail (instance wrongly culled), 77 = skip.
#
# Usage (from the repo root, after building build/lusdview):
