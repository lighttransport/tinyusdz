# tusdrender: the two holes left in MeshLightAPI support on the `next` loader.
#
#   1. inputs:normalize was ignored. A normalized light holds its POWER fixed as
#      its area changes, so its radiance is divided by the emitting (world) area.
#      Without that, a normalized mesh light gets BRIGHTER the larger it is --
#      exactly backwards. Asserted as an equivalence a constant factor cannot
#      fake: a normalized light of area 4 and intensity 40 must render like an
#      un-normalized one of intensity 10.
#
#   2. an INSTANCEABLE emissive mesh registered no light at all. Mesh lights were
#      collected from the flat triangle list only, and an instanced prototype is
#      deliberately not in it -- its geometry lives in a BLAS, placed by the TLAS.
#      However bright, it lit nothing. Asserted as an equivalence too: two
#      instanced lamps must light the floor exactly as the same two lamps written
#      out in full do. (This also pins the per-PLACEMENT emission: each instance is
#      its own light, so registering the prototype once would come out half as
#      bright.)
#
# Both are compared as ratios against a control, so neither can pass by rendering
# a plausible-looking constant. A no-emitter baseline guards against the whole
# thing being satisfied by the fallback camera headlight.
