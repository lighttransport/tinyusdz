# tusdrender `-materialShading lightrt-bsdf`: light must be counted ONCE.
#
# Shade() is an analytic direct-lighting evaluator with a single BSDF-sampled
# bounce layered on top. The bounce ray was gathering radiance that the shading
# point had ALREADY collected analytically, twice over:
#
#   1. the dome / environment. The surface integrates the whole lobe through the
#      split-sum IBL term, and then the bounce ray -- sampled from that same lobe
#      -- escaped to the environment and added it again.
#   2. emissive meshes registered as analytic lights (MeshLightAPI). Direct
#      lighting delivers them via LightCache::mesh, and then a bounce ray landing
#      on the emitter added its emission on top.
#
# An escaping bounce now contributes nothing, and an indirect hit on an
# area-light triangle contributes no emission (TriInfo::area_light).
#
# TUSDR_LIGHT_DOUBLE_COUNT=1 restores the old behavior; the test A/Bs against it,
# and also pins the absolute physics where it can:
#
#   - FURNACE: a white Lambert quad under a uniform dome of radiance 1 must come
#     out at the radiance of the dome. Both shading paths are held to that: the
#     legacy one (no bounce at all) lands at 0.95x, lightrt-bsdf at 1.00x. It used
#     to be 2.00x -- half from re-gathering the dome on the bounce, half from
#     feeding the full BSDF to both split-sum IBL terms.
#   - MESH LIGHT: a floor lit by an emissive quad must get dimmer once the
#     emitter stops being counted twice.
#
# Radiance is recovered from the PNG by inverting the sRGB encode and the
# Reinhard tone map (m = L/(1+L)), so the numbers below are linear.
