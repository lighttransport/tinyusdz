# Regression test: a PointInstancer's `orientations` quaternion is REAL-FIRST.
#
# The next stage stores quats as (w, x, y, z) -- crate is imaginary-first on disk
# and the reader swizzles on load (crate-reader-unpack.cc). InstanceTRS used to read
# the four floats as (x, y, z, w), which changes an authored Z rotation into a
# different transform: instances came out rotated wrongly, and often upside
# down. In usd-wg/assets' OpenChessSet that flipped every PointInstancer'd PAWN
# through the board, where it rendered hidden underneath.
#
# Asserted as an EQUIVALENCE, not a threshold or a golden image: the same mesh,
# placed once by a PointInstancer with a quaternion, and once by an xformOp:rotateZ
# that expresses the SAME rotation, is the same world geometry -- so through a fixed
# camera the two renders must be pixel-identical. Read the quat wrong and the
# instanced copy lands somewhere the xform copy does not.
#
# The prototype is deliberately asymmetric on every axis (an L of three quads at
# different heights); a symmetric prototype would survive a wrong rotation and make
# the check vacuous.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = fail, 77 = skip.
