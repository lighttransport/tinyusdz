"""lusdrender legacy-path texture regression.

The legacy (eager tydra) loader handles every .usda/.usdz -- only .usdc,
-rtPreview and the GPU backends route to the `next` path. It used to flatten each
material to a constant `base_color` and leave every TriInfo::tex_id at -1, so a
photo-textured quad rendered as a UNIFORM GRAY: tydra had resolved and decoded the
UsdUVTexture, but nothing consumed it.

Renders a colour-textured plane and asserts the output is actually textured:
  * saturated  -- a flat/dropped texture shades to pure grayscale (saturation 0)
  * varied     -- many distinct colours, not one flat fill

Also covers the purpose-scoped material binding (material:binding:preview / :full
on an ancestor, as production assets bind), which legacy resolved to nothing --
dropping the material and its texture along with it.

Usage: check_legacy_texture.py <lusdrender> <repo_root> <work_dir>
