"""Vulkan RT skinning: the per-pose BLAS REFIT must trace like the full rebuild.

Under RT, a skinned mesh's vertex buffer is rewritten every pose. That used to
destroy the mesh's BLAS and pay a full MODE_BUILD per frame; the BLAS is now
built once with ALLOW_UPDATE and REFIT in place (MODE_UPDATE) on later poses.
A refit only re-fits node bounds over the same tree, so the set of traced
triangles -- and therefore the image -- must be exactly what the rebuild
produces.

The assertion is an A/B over the same deterministic playback run (--play with
--frames steps a fixed 1/60 s per frame):

  1. default (refit) vs LUSDVIEW_NO_BLAS_REFIT=1 (the historical destroy +
     rebuild path) must render byte-identically at the last frame; and
  2. the last frame must differ from the rest pose, so (1) cannot be satisfied
     by two runs that never posed anything.

Uses the LEGACY loader so the refit path is exercised from
BuildRtSkinnedMeshVertices; check-rt-skinning.py already covers the --next
re-pose against its CPU bake. Exits 77 (skip) when the binary is missing or
the GPU cannot ray trace.
