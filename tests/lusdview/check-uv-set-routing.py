"""lusdview: a texture must sample the UV set its UsdPrimvarReader names.

Three bugs, one behind the other:

  1. tydra-next derived the SECONDARY UV set as `<primary> + "1"`, so only st1 /
     UVMap1 / uv1 were ever extracted. A mesh whose second set is named `uvSet1`,
     `map2` or `UVMap.001` (all common) had no second set at all, and
     RenderTexture::uv_primvar pointed at a set that did not exist.
  2. Even when it did exist, nothing routed it: every texture sampled uv0. The
     second set reached the GPU only as a debug AOV.
  3. Even once it was extracted AND routed, it never reached the GPU on the --next
     path: uv0 rides inside DrawVertex, but uv1 is a parallel array, and the batch
     builder appended the vertices without it. Every batched draw got an EMPTY uv1,
     so the sampler fetched one fixed coordinate and the crop came out FLAT.

The fixture is one quad with `primvars:st` (the full [0,1] square) and
`primvars:uvSet1` (the lower-left quarter). Its base-color texture reads uvSet1,
so a correctly-routed render samples a 4x ZOOMED crop of the checkerboard -- the
same black/white contrast, in 4x bigger cells -- while a mis-routed one samples st
and shows the full fine checker. The control renders the scene with the reader
pointed at `st`.

Asserts, per backend (GL always, Vulkan when present):
  1. the two renders DIFFER -- under bug 1 or 2 the uvSet1 texture silently falls
     back to st and the images are identical; and
  2. the uvSet1 render still has CONTRAST -- under bug 3 it collapses to a flat
     fill. (Do NOT re-add the old "uvSet1 must be flatter than st" assertion: a
     zoomed checkerboard is not flat, and that check passed only because bug 3
     made it flat. It was pinning the bug.)

Exits 77 (skip) if the binary/fixture is missing or no display is available.
