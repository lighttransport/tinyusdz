# Scope is a UsdGeomImageable: it carries `visibility` and `purpose`, and
# authoring purpose on a Scope is the standard way to ship an asset's render and
# proxy representations side by side.
#
# Both are parsed into TYPED fields rather than the generic `props` map, so
# every writer has to emit them explicitly. Neither did: `visibility` was parsed
# and then silently dropped by the USDA printer AND the crate writer (Scope is
# not a GPrim, so ExtractGPrimProperties skipped it, and stage-converter had no
# Scope case at all). A file round-tripped through tusdcat came back with the
# attribute simply gone -- silent data loss.
#
# This pins both directions: usda -> usda and usda -> usdc -> usda.

# 1. The Stage write path (stage-converter.cc) had drifted behind the Layer path
#    (sconv-layer.cc): kilogramsPerUnit and the two USDZ playback metas were
#    written by the latter and simply vanished through the former. An
#    AUTHORED-but-EMPTY `customLayerData = {}` was dropped too -- !empty() is not
#    an authored test, which is what the customLayerDataAuthored flag is for.
#    (The timecode family is written FURTHER UP in the same function. Do not
#    "helpfully" add it again: a duplicate root field corrupts the fieldset
#    encoding and the crate then fails to read back AT ALL -- caught here by
#    stage-meta-001 going from pass to a zero-byte round-trip.)
#
# 2. `reorder nameChildren` / `reorder properties` were parsed into PrimMeta and
#    written by nobody. Their crate spelling is primOrder / propertyOrder (NOT
#    primChildren / properties, which are the full name vectors). Both sides
#    needed work: the reader had no branch for them, AND stage-converter.cc has a
#    kPrimFields WHITELIST -- any field name not on it is re-routed into an
#    ATTRIBUTE spec, so before whitelisting them they came back as bogus
#    `token[] primOrder = [...]` properties rather than as metadata.

# Several TYPED attribute writers emitted only has_default() and had NO
# timeSamples branch at all, so animation on those attributes was dropped
# wholesale on write: SkelRoot/GPrim `extent`, PointInstancer
# positions/orientations/scales (and velocities/accelerations), and Camera's
# token `projection`. The generic attribute path and the xformOp path both
# handled timeSamples fine -- this was per-typed-attribute omission.
#
# Two traps worth keeping pinned:
#   - An ENUM's samples are int64 in memory and TOKENS on disk (projection, like
#     visibility). A pass-through copy emits ints and the file is wrong.
#   - `projection` is in stage-converter.cc's kUniformProps list, which stamped
#     Variability::Uniform UNCONDITIONALLY. A uniform attribute cannot vary over
#     time, and the READER enforces that by failing the entire prim ("declared
#     `uniform`, but a time-sampled value was authored") -- so the moment the
#     writer started emitting projection.timeSamples, the file became unreadable.
#     Uniform is now stamped only when the attribute has no samples.
#
# Also pinned: `uniform token orientation = "rightHanded"` was skipped BECAUSE it
# equals the schema default. An authored opinion is a strong one even when it
# matches the default -- dropping it changes what the layer means.
