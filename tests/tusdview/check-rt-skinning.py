"""tusdview `--next --rt`: skeletal skinning and blendshapes must reach the tracer.

The ray tracer builds its BLAS from actual vertex buffers, so the raster vertex
shader's deform never reaches it. The `--next` path handled that by refusing GPU
skinning under RT entirely and falling back to the load-time CPU bake -- which
means every new time code re-ran the whole converter, the most expensive thing in
the program, to move one skeleton.

RT now keeps the rest pose like the raster path and re-poses those retained
vertices per frame (morph, then linear-blend skinning, from the same bone rows
the raster bone texture is packed from), then rebuilds the BLAS for the meshes
that moved.

The assertion is parity, in both directions:

  1. `--skinning gpu` (the new re-pose) must render EXACTLY what `--skinning cpu`
     (the load-time bake, the known-correct reference) renders at the same time
     code; and
  2. the pose must actually change with the time code, so that (1) cannot be
     satisfied by two rest poses agreeing with each other.

Only the skeletal case is asserted. The re-pose applies blendshape morph too (in
deform.glsl's order: morph, then skin), but no fixture here animates a blendshape
under `--time` -- neither the next path nor the legacy Tydra path moves for
models/blendshape-and-animation-test-001.usda, which is a separate, pre-existing
gap. Asserting morph parity against that would only assert two rest poses.
