"""tusdview: --texture-fit must actually decide whether textures are processed.

CPU block compression is the single most expensive stage of a texture-heavy
load -- ALab alab_set01 spent 362 s of a 395 s load encoding 507 textures on a
card with 13 GiB free -- so the viewer skips it when the scene comfortably fits.
That decision had NO test at all: a regression that flipped it either way showed
up only as a slow (or needlessly degraded) large-scene run, never as a failure.

This asserts the decision itself, read back from the `next: texture-fit=` line,
using --vram-budget to rehearse different card sizes on a tiny scene:

  1. `never`  -> always skips, even on a 1 GiB card;
  2. `always` -> always processes, even on a 64 GiB card (it must suppress the
     separate "comfort budget" heuristic too, or `always` would not mean always);
  3. modest < default < aggressive thresholds, and the decision flips at most
     once as the card shrinks (catches a mis-wired percentage without depending
     on any absolute number);
  4. `4G` reports exactly 4096 MiB regardless of --vram-budget;
  5. a bogus value exits non-zero rather than silently falling back;
  6. `never` leaves the decoder's edge cap at 0 -- the precondition that
     re-enables the KTX2 zero-copy passthrough.

Exits 77 (skip) when the binary is missing or Vulkan is unavailable.
