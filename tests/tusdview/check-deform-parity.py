"""tusdview `--next`: the GPU deform must land where the CPU bake lands.

One harness, one claim, run over several fixtures: whatever the vertex shader
does per frame (blendshape morph, then linear-blend skinning) has to put the
geometry in the SAME PLACE as baking those deforms into the mesh on the CPU. The
CPU bake is the reference because it works in mesh-local space on the authored
points, before any of the batching, welding or world-baking the GPU path depends
on -- so the two agree only if that machinery is right.

Everything is rendered in `--mode depth` through a FIXED USD camera:

  * depth is purely geometric, so the comparison is not polluted by the known,
    by-design shading difference (the GPU path skins the REST normal; the bake
    recomputes normals from the deformed points); and
  * a fixed camera, because the two paths legitimately frame the scene
    differently under auto-fit -- the GPU path pads the mesh box by `morphExtent`
    so a morphed mesh is never frustum-culled, while the bake's box is exact.
    Auto-framing would move the camera between the two renders and swamp any real
    geometric difference. (An earlier version of this comparison thresholded luma
    at 25 to get a silhouette; the background grid is brighter than that, so the
    mask covered the whole frame and the check was vacuously true.)

It also asserts the fixture DEFORMS at all (rest vs posed depth), so the parity
check above can never go quietly vacuous.

Exits 77 (skip) when the binary, the scene or a usable GPU is missing.
