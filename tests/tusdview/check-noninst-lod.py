"""tusdview raster LOD must apply to NON-instanced meshes too.

Two bugs, one test:

  1. The next loader gave every static-batched (non-instanced) mesh the running
     SCENE-bounds accumulator as its AABB, not its own bounds. Every unique mesh
     therefore claimed to span the whole scene, which silently disabled the
     per-mesh frustum cull (nothing is ever outside the frustum) and any
     size-based decision (nothing is ever small on screen).

  2. Raster LOD only ever looked at meshes with instanceCount() > 0, so unique
     geometry got no LOD at all -- no sub-pixel cull, no box-proxy substitution.

The fixture is a field of small, widely-spread cubes (each with its own material,
so the static batcher keeps them separate) plus one large cube. Auto-framed, the
small cubes are far under the proxy threshold and the large one is far over.

  --raster-lod must then collapse the small cubes into box proxies (visible mesh
  count and drawn triangles both drop sharply) while leaving the large one drawn.

If either bug returns, every mesh looks scene-sized and nothing is proxied, so
the LOD-on and LOD-off stats come out identical and this fails.

Exits 77 (skip) when the binary is missing or headless rendering is unavailable.
