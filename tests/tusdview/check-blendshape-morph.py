"""tusdview `--next`: an ordinary (non-instanced) blendshaped mesh must MORPH,
and it must morph in the RIGHT SPACE.

Two bugs, one test.

(a) BuildMorphChannelsNext / BakeBlendShapes were only ever called on the
    INSTANCED prototype path. A plain blendshaped mesh -- which is what almost
    every rig in the wild is -- went through the static batch path, which called
    neither, so it rendered its REST shape at every time code.

(b) That path world-BAKES its vertices (the batch's own transform is identity),
    but the blendshape offsets are authored in MESH-local space, and every
    consumer -- deform.glsl and BuildNextRtDeformedVertices -- adds the delta
    straight onto the position it is handed. The deltas were left in mesh space,
    so a blendshaped mesh under a rotated or scaled parent morphed along the
    wrong axes. (Skinning already did the equivalent: its bone rows are
    invW * (G*sm*invG) * W.) The instanced path is exempt -- its vertices stay
    mesh-local.

The geometry checks render in `--mode depth` through a FIXED USD camera. Both
matter:

  * depth is purely geometric, so the comparison is not polluted by the known,
    by-design shading difference (the GPU path morphs positions and skins the
    REST normal; the CPU bake recomputes normals from the morphed points); and
  * a fixed camera, because the two paths legitimately frame the scene
    differently -- the GPU path pads the mesh box by `morphExtent` so a morphed
    mesh is never frustum-culled, while the bake's box is exact. Auto-framing
    would otherwise move the camera between the two renders and swamp any real
    geometric difference.

Exits 77 (skip) when the binary or a usable GPU is missing.
