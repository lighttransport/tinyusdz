# refactor-next: src/next Optimization & Hardening Roadmap

Status: **post-roadmap cleanup**. The original 10-phase roadmap has landed.
Use `scripts/run-next-checks.sh` for a focused standalone validation pass before
and after follow-up refactors.

Landed so far:
- **Phase 0** — this plan + `bench_pcp_compose` instrumentation + baselines.
- **Phase 1** — recursion/cycle hardening (ExpansionFrame stack-frame chain,
  ancestor-arc + namespace-depth guards, iterative SourcesForPath); lazy
  per-prim `values_`/`time_samples_`; dead `ValueStorage` byte API removed.
  Also fixed a parser bug (apiSchemas/variantSets dropped quoted names).
- **Phase 2** — three libFuzzer harnesses + `next_usdcat` + `next_corpus_parse`
  gate; 6 fuzzer-found crash/UB bugs fixed and pinned by a replay test.
- **Phase 3** — copy-on-write array storage in `Value` (12× memory cut on the
  clone benchmark).
- **Phase 4** — `FindSpecs` memoization (−24% BuildStage). GraftSubtree
  child-walk (M5) landed with a validity-guarded fallback. M3 landed 2026-07-16
  as open-addressed caches/memos instead of a full u32-interned rekeying:
  `StackSpecCache` (per-stack Specs memo, no per-call key copy),
  `Src::specs_`/`SpecsFor` (self-resetting per-Src memo), `SrcCache`
  (sources_cache), and `arc_target_memo_` (per-arc external-target resolution
  keyed by anchor+asset+expression-vars fingerprint). Island/ALab/Caldera
  load+compose −14–16%, byte-identical, TSan-clean — see
  doc/memory-and-performance.md §M3.
- **Phase 5 (core)** — stable variant-content instance key (fixes pointer
  aliasing S4); the instance key now folds in the accumulated variant selections
  and non-identity layer offsets (I1). Strongest-opinion tri-state
  `instanceable` landed (`instanceable_authored`, so authored `false` ≠
  unauthored — I2). Instance↔prototype **path-translation API landed** (I3):
  `Cache::TranslatePathToPrototype` (longest enclosing instance prefix, recursing
  through nested instances, empty when under none) and
  `TranslatePathFromPrototype` (single named instance); covered by
  `test_pcp.cc:test_path_translation` including a two-level nested case.
  PointInstancer typed accessors/transform computation (plus
  `ComputeMaskAtTime`) and lightweight Tydra draw-reference expansion now exist,
  including direct and inherited mesh material IDs, prototype-relative mesh
  transforms, and unresolved-prototype diagnostics on draw refs. Bounds-checked
  draw view resolution, O(1) per-instancer draw ranges, and draw/prototype
  binding validators are available; opt-in transformed mesh duplication is
  available for consumers that cannot use draw refs directly. (The M3 pcp
  hot-map work, once deferred, landed 2026-07-16 — see Phase 4 above.)
- **Phase 6** — payload LoadRules model (`pcp/load-rules.{hh,cc}`, a
  `UsdStageLoadRules` port); `LoadPayload(With/WithoutDescendants)`,
  `SetLoadRules`; `UnloadPayload` recomposes (S7 fix); BuildStage rebuilds
  prototype maps from scratch (fixes stale-grouping nondeterminism + payload-on-
  instance split).
- **Phase 7 (E1)** — USDA parser now honors arc list-op qualifiers
  (prepend->front, append->back, delete->remove, explicit->replace) within a
  spec.
- **Phase 7 (E4)** — typed composition diagnostics: `Cache::ErrorCode` +
  `Cache::CompositionIssue` accumulated on Impl; all err-emitting sites route
  through `AddIssue` (records a typed code + mirrors the message into the
  existing `err` out-param, no API break). Recorded even when `err==nullptr`;
  parallel-worker issues folded in at the post-join merge.
  `GetCompositionIssues`/`ClearCompositionIssues` exposed.
- **Phase 8 (arrays, M1/8.4)** — read+write lazy coverage for Vec4f/Quatf/
  Vec2-4d/Quatd/Matrix2-4d **and half-typed** arrays (Half/Vec2-4h/Quath, lazy
  + byte-exact passthrough; half↔float via crate-format.hh). TimeSamples sample
  values reuse the same UnpackValue→UnpackArray lazy path. Corpus now has
  **zero** "Unsupported array type" warnings.
- **Phase 8 (M4/8.1)** — PrimSpecMeta footprint split: cold fields
  (doc/comment/instance_prototype/apiSchemas/variantSets/variantSelections/
  relocates) moved behind a lazily-allocated `unique_ptr<PrimSpecMetaExt>`; hot
  fields (flags, 4 arc lists, legacy variantSelection, layer_offset) stay
  inline. `sizeof(PrimSpecMeta)` 344B→160B without ext (2.15×); ext (192B) paid
  only by the prim minority that carries cold data. `Layer::finalize()`
  shrink_to_fit's `prims_`.
- **Phase 8 (M6/8.2)** — pooled token storage (`TokenPool`: one blob + (off,len)
  spans) replaces the per-token `std::string` table in the crate reader: 8
  bytes/token + no per-token alloc, cutting the transient parse peak. Consumers
  copy by value (unchanged behavior); `CrateReader::tokens()` now materializes
  on demand (diagnostics-only). The `CrateDataSource` token table is never
  populated (token arrays decode eagerly), so it carries no steady-state cost.
- **Phase 8 (M7/8.3)** — mmap-backed `CrateDataSource`: a second read-only
  memory-map backing behind `base()`/`size()` (readers/bounds-checks
  untouched); `MmapFile()` (posix; nullptr→owned fallback on WASM/non-posix/
  failure), destructor munmaps on last shared_ptr. `ReadFile` prefers mmap;
  `CrateReadOptions::use_mmap` (default on) gates it. No in-heap crate copy for
  file loads; lazy values read straight from the mapping.
- **TimeSamples decoding** — crate TimeSamples now decode into per-property
  storage (was skipped on read); reads next- and pxr-written files.
- **Phase 7 (E2)** — layer offsets compose through the arc chain
  (ProcessArc + LayerOffset.Compose) and bake into time-sample times at
  BuildStage (CopyLocalOpinions remaps t -> offset + scale*t); USDA
  `(offset; scale)` captured by the parser; offset folded into the instance key.
- **Phase 9 (F2 + TSAN stress)** — LayerRegistry parses outside the lock
  (parallel layer load); a concurrent-payload-edit TSAN stress test guards the
  Phase-6 paths.
- **Phase 9 (F6)** — dropped the *recursive* engine mutex: the two
  re-entrantly-called methods (ComputePrimIndex, Invalidate) split into a public
  entry (locks once) + a lock-free `*_locked` worker; internal callers use the
  worker, so `api_mu_` is now a plain `std::mutex`.
  `LIGHTUSD_NEXT_RECURSIVE_LOCK` restores the recursive mutex as an escape
  hatch. TSAN-clean with threads on.
- **Phase 9 (F4, opt-in)** — `LIGHTUSD_NEXT_FINE_LOCKS` makes `api_mu_` a
  `std::shared_timed_mutex`: read-only queries + the ComputePrimIndex cache-hit
  fast path take a shared lock (concurrent), builds/writers take the exclusive
  lock; the write-lock double-check in `ComputePrimIndex_locked` keeps a
  contended prim built once (subsumes the in-flight-future dedup). Default and
  recursive policies keep READ==WRITE. Clean under ThreadSanitizer for test_pcp
  (incl. 8-thread×1000-iter concurrent queries on one shared cache).
  **Follow-up (post-roadmap review):** the READ_LOCK/WRITE_LOCK call sites and
  the `PcpMutex` policy selection (`pcp/cache-lock.hh`) had been written but
  `LIGHTUSD_NEXT_FINE_LOCKS` was never exposed as a CMake `option()` — every
  build silently fell back to the default single-exclusive-mutex policy no
  matter what a caller intended, i.e. T1 was still live in every actual build.
  Added the option to `src/next/CMakeLists.txt` (requires
  `LIGHTUSD_NEXT_ENABLE_THREAD`). Turning it on for the first time also
  surfaced two bugs the option's absence had kept latent: (1)
  `PropNameTable::is_frozen()` had no definition at all under
  `LIGHTUSD_ENABLE_THREAD` (only the non-threaded stub existed), so any
  threaded build referencing it failed to link -- fixed with an atomic-load
  read of the published snapshot pointer; (2) `test_tydra_next.cc`'s
  `TestNameTableFreezeStability` asserted that interning a new name while
  frozen unfreezes the table -- true under the *old* freeze() scheme, but
  freeze() was redesigned (see the F4 bullet's "lock-free reader" note above)
  to keep the snapshot published and let a miss fall through to the locked
  path instead, specifically so a concurrent lock-free reader is never
  disturbed. The test predates that redesign and was never caught because
  `is_frozen()` was a dead stub always returning `false`. Verified with a
  TSan build (clang, `LIGHTUSD_NEXT_ENABLE_THREAD=ON` +
  `LIGHTUSD_NEXT_FINE_LOCKS=ON`): 9 test binaries × 3 runs, 0 races; default
  (non-threaded) ctest suite still 35/35.
- **Phase 9 (F3)** — `layer_stacks`/`path_table` are `std::deque` (stable
  element addresses): a PrimIndex borrows raw pointers into these tables and
  resolves node sites lock-free (`SitePath`, used cross-thread), so a `vector`
  realloc from a concurrent build would dangle them. `SitePath`'s bounds check
  uses a per-PrimIndex size snapshot taken under the build lock, race-free
  against concurrent appends.
- **Phase 9 (F5)** — deterministic prototype assignment: the per-prim
  ComputePrimIndex cache and the parallel merge pick the lexicographically
  smallest member path as the prototype (`AssignPrototype` prefer_min mode), so
  the grouping is identical regardless of computation order/threads. BuildStage
  keeps first-in-namespace-order (single-pass, already deterministic); flatten
  output and the round-trip corpus are unchanged.

- **Phase 7 (S5 + E3)** — full cross-layer list-op representation. Arc
  qualifiers (prepend/append/delete/explicit) are stored per field in a lazily
  allocated `ArcListOpEdits` on the cold ext (the inline arc vectors stay as the
  within-spec effective list, so Phase 8.1's footprint is preserved); the USDA
  parser records them. With `CompositionOptions::apply_list_ops` (default on),
  `ExpandArcs` composes each arc field once across the site via `MergeArcField`
  (AOUSD SdfListOp weakest→strongest: explicit-replace / prepend / append /
  delete / dedup), in LIVRPS order. The USDA writer re-emits the authored
  qualifier (was always `prepend`), and the crate (USDC) writer/reader preserve
  it via a companion `<arc>_listOp` token[] field (the flat token[] still
  carries the within-spec effective list, so the change is additive). Tests:
  specialize chain, cross-layer delete + explicit-replace, USDA writer fidelity,
  USDC edit round-trip. doc/pcp.md has the implementation-status note +
  relocates scope. Remaining knob: whether to default `apply_list_ops` on after
  a corpus review.
- **Phase 10 (M9)** — `Cache::ComposePrim(path)` composes (and caches) one prim
  on first access, reusing BuildStageRec's SourcesForPath + ComposeInto step
  without materializing the whole stage; `ComposedChildNames(path)` for lazy
  descent; dropped by Invalidate/InvalidateLayer/SetLoadRules; fine-locks shared
  read fast path. Instancing/relocates stay stage-level (BuildStage
  authoritative). The lazy attribute entry point landed too:
  `EvalAttributeLazy(Cache&, Path, attr, opts)` resolves time samples / default
  via the shared `AttributeEval::EvalFromPrimSpec` and follows connections
  across lazily-composed prims -- no BuildStage.
- **Hardening (post-audit)** — fixed: spurious ext allocation in
  compose/flatten (`has_ext()` guard, restores the 8.1 footprint win); `issues_`
  lifecycle (cleared on Invalidate*/SetLoadRules; `GetCompositionIssues` returns
  by value to avoid a fine-locks dangling ref); `TokenPool` >4 GiB blob guard;
  `DropInstancing` orphans sibling `prototype_of` when a prototype is dropped.
- **Malformed USDC regression gate** — generated next-only crate fixtures now
  cover bad magic, truncated bootstrap, invalid TOC offsets/ranges, excessive
  section counts, missing required sections, allocation caps, and malformed
  FIELD/FIELDSET/SPECS payloads. These live alongside crash replay fixtures and
  assert returned errors rather than crashes or unbounded allocation.
- **Crate reader TU split** — public `CrateReader` API wrappers and source
  selection moved to `crate-reader-api.cc`; stage reconstruction moved to
  `crate-reader-stage.cc`; array decode/lazy-array probing moved to
  `crate-reader-arrays.cc`; scalar-vector decode moved to
  `crate-reader-vectors.cc`; scalar/non-array value dispatch stays in
  `crate-reader.cc` behind `crate-reader-internal.hh`.
- **ASCII parser TU split** — private parser implementation declarations moved
  to `ascii-parser-internal.hh`; stage/layer metadata parsing moved to
  `ascii-parser-metadata.cc`; namespaced-name parsing, skip helpers, property
  metadata, and parser diagnostics moved to `ascii-parser-utils.cc`;
  prim/property/relationship parsing moved to `ascii-parser-prim.cc`;
  `timeSamples` and variant parsing moved to dedicated TUs.
- **Writer/PCP helper split** — crate lazy-array pass-through policy moved to
  `crate-writer-passthrough.inc`; crate property/spec emission moved to
  `crate-writer-properties.inc`; PCP stage opinion fill, worker merge helpers,
  and arc list-op merge moved to focused includes.
- **Comprehensive generated USDC fixture** — `next_test_usdc_roundtrip` now
  builds a dense in-memory layer and writes/reads it through Crate. The fixture
  covers layer metadata, `customLayerData`, prim `customData`/`assetInfo`/
  `apiSchemas`, composition arcs, mesh arrays, per-property metadata,
  relationships, connection-flagged properties, Shader/Material connections,
  PointInstancer prototype/array data, `ids`/`invisibleIds`, and time samples.
- **Focused split-regression tests** — `next_test_usdc_writer` now pins
  `EncodeValue` fallback roundtrips for non-inline scalars/vectors/matrix,
  string/token/asset, and nested dictionaries; `next_test_pcp` now pins
  extracted-prototype collision handling, internal relationship remapping, and
  original-instance subtree orphaning.

`apply_list_ops` is now **default ON** (set false for legacy strong-first
concatenation). The decision rests on three checks:
 1. **Corpus-diff** (flatten each file with the flag off vs on): across the
    top-level corpus **no file differs or changes compose-success** — flipping
    is regression-free (the stock corpus has no file combining subLayers + arcs).
 2. **Positive coverage**: two dedicated fixtures
    (`tests/usda/composition/listop-xlayer-{delete,explicit}-000.usda`) differ
    exactly as intended under the review and nothing else does.
 3. **pxrUSD A/B**: flattening those cross-layer assets with OpenUSD `usdcat
    --flatten` and with next, `apply_list_ops=ON` **matches pxrUSD exactly**
    (the stronger layer's `delete` drops / a bare list replaces the weak
    sublayer's reference → only `fromB` survives), while the old OFF default was
    **non-conformant** (wrongly kept the deleted/replaced `fromA`).
So ON is the AOUSD-correct behavior, matches the reference implementation, and
is regression-free on the corpus — hence the default. (This review also
surfaced that the next USDA parser never read `subLayers` from text — a
double-consume bug, now fixed — and that the Release test build compiled out
`assert()`; tests now build with `-UNDEBUG`.) **The 10-phase roadmap is
complete.** The sections below are the original spec.

## Current Cleanup Backlog

The 10-phase roadmap is complete. The active work is now cleanup, validation,
and behavior-neutral split work:

1. **Docs/status hygiene** — keep this file, `src/next/README.md`, and
   `doc/memory-and-performance.md` aligned with landed behavior and benchmark
   deltas. When changing next test coverage, also update `doc/testing-cpp.md`.
2. **Standalone validation polish** — `scripts/run-next-checks.sh` is the
   canonical next smoke/regression entrypoint. Keep `next` outside the main
   regression gate until the assert-based tests are fully converted or otherwise
   hardened, even though the standalone CMake now forces asserts on for test
   targets.
3. **Behavior-neutral TU split** — the high-value split pass is complete:
   `crate-reader` API/source/stage/array/vector helpers, parser implementation/
   metadata/property/timeSamples/variant helpers, writer pass-through/property
   helpers, PCP helper/opinion-fill/merge/list-op includes, and value-parser
   helper include units are separated. Remaining cleanup is opportunistic only:
   smaller `EncodeValue` scalar/array subhelpers, deeper PCP instance-flatten
   extraction, or further parser arc/metadata refinements if future edits touch
   those sections.
4. **Memory observability** — make benchmark output stable enough to diff:
   struct sizes, `Layer::stats()`, RSS, lazy/eager clone RSS, crate write
   pass-through/reencode counts, and mmap-vs-heap attribution. Current
   `benchmark_next memstats` / `memstats-file` output covers these basics,
   including public `source_was_mmap` / `input_was_mmap` result fields.
5. **Format parity** — maintain the dense generated USDC fixture and focused
   malformed-crate fixtures. Continue adding next USDA/USDC writer parity tests
   and optional pxrUSD `usdcat` comparison when available.
6. **Remaining feature gaps** — keep broadening low-memory flatten coverage for
   mixed USDA/USDC/USDZ dependency graphs. Basic filesystem USDA sublayers and
   references are supported and covered. Compressed bool arrays are decoded
   (compressed-integral lanes canonicalized to true/false in
   `src/next/crate/crate-reader-arrays.cc`) and covered by regression tests.

Recently closed cleanup items:

- Blender/nanobind experimental bindings were deprecated out of the active next
  plan.
- PointInstancer support now includes typed accessors, extracted instance data,
  Tydra draw references, prototype material/transform bindings, validation, and
  opt-in transformed mesh duplication.
- Malformed USDC coverage now includes generated TOC/table/payload edge cases
  plus crash replay fixtures.
- A broad generated USDC roundtrip fixture now covers cross-feature read/write
  reconstruction instead of relying only on small single-feature tests.

Goals, in priority order:

1. **Secure** — no segfault/UB/stack-overflow on malformed or adversarial input
   (the module builds with `-fno-exceptions`; every failure must be a returned error).
2. **Low memory** — extend the lazy-ValueRep architecture; eliminate avoidable copies.
3. **Faster** — remove redundant work and quadratic algorithms in composition/flatten.
4. **Instancing** — complete the instance-key model and add consumer APIs.
5. **Lazy loading** — a real load-rules model for payloads (OpenUSD `UsdStageLoadRules`).
6. **Multithread-ready** — replace the single big lock with minimal, provably-safe
   locking; zero overhead when `LIGHTUSD_ENABLE_THREAD` is OFF.

Reference implementation for hardening/verification: `../OpenUSD/pxr/`
(Pcp prim indexing, `UsdStageLoadRules`, `Usd_InstanceCache`, `VtArray` CoW,
crate `_MmapFile`, `pcp/errors.h`). Spec reference: AOUSD Core §10 (see `doc/pcp.md`).

All file:line evidence below was verified by reading the code at HEAD `59801312`.
**It is a frozen historical snapshot, not current status** — every M/S/I item
and T1 are marked resolved in "Landed so far" above; only read this section
for *why* a change was made, never to decide whether something is still open.
A later review (post-roadmap) that treated M1/M3/M4/M5/M7 as open purely
because they appear in this table wasted a pass re-discovering they were
already fixed — check "Landed so far" first, always.

## 1. Verified problem inventory

### 1.1 Security / correctness

| # | Problem | Evidence |
|---|---------|----------|
| S1 | `BuildStageRec` has **no depth guard**. An ancestor self-reference (`def "A" { def "B" (references = </A>) {} }`) produces an infinitely-growing namespace: the per-prim-path cycle set starts fresh for every composed path, so cross-ancestral cycles are invisible → recursion until stack overflow. | `pcp/cache.cc:766` (no depth param), `cache.cc:580` (fresh cycle set per path) |
| S2 | Cycle detection copies a `std::set<std::string>` **per arc, per recursion level** — O(depth² × path-length) copies; the key is a concatenated string `stack-id + ":" + site`. | `pcp/cache.cc:466-469, 478-481, 529-531` |
| S3 | `SourcesForPath` recurses on the parent path — a pathological query path with thousands of components can blow the stack independently of S1. | `pcp/cache.cc:598-614` |
| S4 | Variant content layer-stacks are interned under a **pointer-derived key** `"variant:" + uintptr_t(vd)`. After `Invalidate` + recompose, a freed-and-reallocated `VariantData` can reuse an address while stale instance keys persist in `prototype_by_key` → **false prototype aliasing**. Also defeats prototype sharing across identical files (distinct `Layer` objects ⇒ distinct keys). | `pcp/cache.cc:518-520`; `DropInstancing` removes by prim only (`cache.cc:372`) |
| S5 | List-edit qualifiers (`prepend`/`append`/`delete`/`reorder`) are consumed and **discarded** by the USDA parser; arcs are flat `vector<string>` in `PrimSpecMeta`. `delete`/`explicit` are unrepresentable; `prepend` vs `append` cross-layer ordering is wrong per AOUSD §10.3.2. | `parser/ascii-parser.cc:577-584`; `layer/prim-spec.hh:90-93` |
| S6 | Layer offsets are never composed through arc chains (`ProcessArc` copies the parent offset only; sublayer `(offset/scale)` not parsed; value evaluation has no offset handling). | `pcp/cache.cc:446`; `layer/layer.hh:31`; `eval/attribute-eval.cc` |
| S7 | `deferred_payload_prims` is **mutated inside** `ExpandArcs` — a logically-const query writes shared state mid-expansion (blocks fine-grained threading); `UnloadPayload` invalidates without recomposing, so `HasDeferredPayload` returns stale `false` until something recomposes. | `pcp/cache.cc:556-559`; `cache.cc:1091`, `cache.cc:1059-1063` |
| S8 | No fuzz targets and no usd-wg corpus regression gate cover `src/next` (legacy has both; the corpus runner already accepts `--lusdcat PATH`). | `tests/fuzzer/usdcparser_fuzzmain.cc` (legacy-only); `tests/parse-asset-corpus.mjs:42` |

### 1.2 Memory / speed

| # | Problem | Evidence |
|---|---------|----------|
| M1 | `Value::copy_from` **deep-copies array vectors** for every non-lazy array type. Every compose/flatten/Clone path pays it: all USDA input, token arrays, and eager crate types. Lazy crate arrays already copy as a refcount bump. | `types/value.cc:631-658`; callers `composition/composition.cc:171,206`, `pcp/cache.cc:651,675`, `layer/prim-spec.cc:143,340-389` |
| M2 | `FindSpecs` is re-resolved 3–5× for the same (stack, site) per composed prim, each call allocating a fresh `vector<SpecRef>` with a `std::string layer_id` copy per hit. | `pcp/cache.cc:217-231`; callers at `cache.cc:243,305,319,663,728` |
| M3 | pcp hot containers are string-keyed (`index_cache`, `sources_cache`, `Site{string,string}`, payload sets, prototype maps) although an `InternPath` u32 table already exists and is used only for `CompNode::site_path_idx`. | `pcp/cache.cc:96-121` |
| M4 | `PrimSpec` carries ~660 B inline (`PrimSpecMeta` ≈ 350 B: 3 strings + 8 vectors + variant machinery; three `unordered_map` members) plus **2 mandatory heap allocations** per prim (`ValueStorage` + `TimeSampleStorage`) even when empty. `ValueStorage::data_`/`allocate()`/`raw()` is dead code (`store()` only uses `values_`). | `layer/prim-spec.hh:78-108,431-444`; `prim-spec.cc:119-147,319-333` |
| M5 | `Compositor::GraftSubtree` scans **all prims of the source layer** with string-prefix compares per graft call → O(layer_prims × graft_count) on the flatten path (the one WASM uses). | `composition/composition.cc:344-364`; call sites `:251,271,303,331,413` |
| M6 | Crate reading copies the whole file to one heap `std::string`; `Read(ptr,len)` double-copies; **no mmap** path exists in src/next. | `crate/crate-reader.cc:886-938`; `crate/crate-data-source.hh:68` |
| M7 | Tokens: LZ4 blob → one `std::string` per token, then re-copied into Values and into `PropNameTable` (3 copies of the token table). | `crate/crate-reader.cc:1058-1117, 275-280, 864-875` |
| M8 | Lazy array coverage now includes Vec4f/Quatf, half arrays, Vec2-4d/Quatd/Matrix2-4d, and crate TimeSamples sample values. Remaining risk is regressions in unsupported/unknown crate array layouts, which must keep `block_len=0` so writer pass-through never copies guessed bytes. | `crate/crate-reader.cc`, `crate/crate-data-source.cc`, `tests/next/test_lazy_array.cc`, `tests/next/test_crate_alloc_guard.cc` |
| M9 | `BuildStage` materializes the entire composed stage eagerly; read-only consumers pay O(scene) RSS. | `pcp/cache.cc:766-835` |

### 1.3 Threading

| # | Problem | Evidence |
|---|---------|----------|
| T1 | ~~One `std::recursive_mutex api_mu_` serializes every public cache entry point when `LIGHTUSD_ENABLE_THREAD` is ON.~~ **CLOSED** — Phase 9 F6 dropped the recursive engine mutex (plain `std::mutex` + lock-free `*_locked` internals); Phase 9 F4 added the `LIGHTUSD_NEXT_FINE_LOCKS` shared/exclusive policy on top, and the CMake option to actually turn it on landed in the post-roadmap follow-up (see the F4 bullet above) — until then the option existed in code but was unreachable, so every real build still paid the T1 cost regardless of intent. | `pcp/cache.cc:24,79` (historical) |
| T2 | `LayerRegistry` holds its mutex **across file parse**, so the "parallel" layer prefetch in `PrewarmPrimIndices` parses one file at a time. | `pcp/layer-registry.cc:69-92`; `cache.cc:936-951` — **STATUS UNCLEAR**: Phase 9 F2 ("LayerRegistry parses outside the lock") claims this closed; not re-verified line-by-line in the post-roadmap review, worth a fresh read before relying on it. |
| T3 | Race inventory if the big lock were removed: `path_table`/interning, `layer_stacks` vector reallocation under readers, `index_cache`/`sources_cache`, `site_to_indices`, deferred-payload set mutation mid-expansion (S7), instance maps, registry counters. | `pcp/cache.cc:92-121, 556-559` — covered by Phase 9 F3 (deque-stable addressing) and F5 (deterministic prototype assignment); TSan-clean per the F4 bullet, but see the F4 follow-up note: that TSan pass predates the CMake-wiring fix, so it never actually ran the fine-locks code path either. Re-verified in the post-roadmap review (9 binaries × 3 runs, 0 races) — see F4 bullet. |

### 1.4 Instancing

| # | Problem | Evidence |
|---|---------|----------|
| I1 | Instance key omits accumulated variant selections and layer offsets; variant content contributes a pointer-derived stack id (S4). OpenUSD's `PcpInstanceKey` includes all authored variant selections from every node; `Usd_InstanceKey` additionally hashes load rules relative to the instance. | `pcp/cache.cc:315-336`; `pxr/usd/pcp/instanceKey.cpp:54-68`, `pxr/usd/usd/instanceKey.cpp:42-106` |
| I2 | Instanceable predicate = "any spec authored `instanceable=true`" instead of strongest-opinion; authored `false` is indistinguishable from unauthored (`bool`, not tri-state). | `pcp/cache.cc:302-310`; `layer/prim-spec.hh` |
| I3 | No instance↔prototype path-translation API for consumers (Tydra); nested instancing structurally works but is untested. | `pcp/cache.hh:67-101` |
| I4 | PointInstancer typed accessors, transform/mask-style data extraction, prototype mesh bindings, lightweight Tydra draw refs, prototype-relative transforms, per-draw material IDs, unresolved-prototype diagnostics, bounds-checked draw view resolution, O(1) per-instancer draw ranges, draw/prototype binding validators, and opt-in transformed mesh duplication now exist. | `src/next/schema/geom-point-instancer.hh`; `src/tydra/next/render-extract.hh`; `src/tydra/next/render-data.hh` |

## 2. Phased plan

Each phase is independently landable. Ordering rationale: security first (it
restructures `ProcessArc`/`ExpandArcs` signatures that later phases build on),
then the safety nets (fuzz/corpus), then memory/speed, then semantics, then
concurrency last (after mid-query mutations are gone).

### Phase 0 — Plan + baselines (this doc)

- Write this document.
- Add a `mem_stats` utility (extend `benchmark_next` or a tiny new target) printing
  `sizeof(Value/PrimSpec/PrimSpecMeta/CompNode)` and `Layer::memory_usage()`/`stats()`
  for a 100k-prim synthetic layer.
- Add a pcp compose wall-time benchmark (N references × M prims; nothing currently
  times `Cache::BuildStage`).
- Capture baselines into `doc/memory-and-performance.md`:
  `bench_lazy_mem` (`gen`/`eager`/`lazy`/`genmany`), `benchmark_next`,
  WASM flatten memlog (`-DLIGHTUSD_FLATTEN_MEMLOG`, `pipeline/flatten.cc:29-35`),
  massif on a large `.usdc`.

### Phase 1 — Security: recursion & cycle hardening (S1–S3 + quick wins)

OpenUSD analogue: `pxr/usd/pcp/primIndex_StackFrame.h` — a linked chain of stack
frames walked to detect site re-entry across recursive index builds.

1. Depth-guard `BuildStageRec` (thread a `depth` param, fail with error at
   `options.max_depth`) and the stage child traversals (`stage/stage.cc:187`).
2. Replace the per-arc copied cycle sets with a **stack-frame chain**:
   `struct ExpansionFrame { uint32_t stack_idx; const std::string* site; const ExpansionFrame* prev; }`
   threaded through `SourcesForPath → ExpandArcs → ProcessArc`. Reproduces the
   current in-expansion cycle semantics over the chain, *and* detects ancestral
   re-entry (S1's real fix). Emit an ArcCycle error and drop the arc
   (continue-past-errors, AOUSD §10.6). This is simultaneously the S2 memory/CPU
   fix — one restructure, not two.
3. Convert `SourcesForPath` parent recursion to an iterative root→leaf loop (S3).
4. Parser/crate recursion audit: USDA nested-prim depth cap (mirror crate's
   `max_path_depth`); cross-check crate bounds against `pxr/usd/sdf/crateFile.cpp`
   patterns (ValueRep payload-offset validation, LZ4 compressed-size sanity).
   Document the constraint that any future recursive value type (dictionaries)
   must carry a depth cap.
5. Quick memory wins riding the same PR series: delete dead
   `ValueStorage::data_/allocate/raw/reserve`; lazily allocate `time_samples_`
   on first `add_time_sample` (accessors already null-check).

Tests (all must error, not crash; run under ASAN): ancestor self-reference,
mutual A↔B cross-file reference cycle, self-payload, variant content referencing
its host, 1000-deep authored hierarchy, reference chain at exactly `max_depth`.

### Phase 2 — Fuzzers + corpus gate for next (S8)

- `tests/fuzzer/next_usdc_fuzzmain.cc` — prepend `PXR-USDC` magic (same trick as
  the legacy harness), feed next's USDC reader with tight `CrateReadOptions` caps
  so OOM ≠ finding.
- `tests/fuzzer/next_usda_fuzzmain.cc` — USDA reader path.
- `tests/fuzzer/next_compose_fuzzmain.cc` — split input into length-prefixed
  pseudo-layers, register via `Cache::PreloadLayer` + stub resolver,
  `ComposeStageFromLayer` with `max_depth=64`. The only harness exercising Phase 1.
- New `LIGHTUSD_NEXT_BUILD_FUZZERS` option in `src/next/CMakeLists.txt`
  (clang-only, `-fsanitize=fuzzer,address`).
- `next_usdcat` CLI (~100 LOC: load + compose + print) and a `corpus-parse-next`
  CTest entry mirroring `corpus-parse-native` (commit `88412f30`), gated on
  `USD_WG_ASSETS_DIR` with graceful SKIP; `--max-fail 0` parse, `--max-fail N`
  flatten while composition gaps remain.
- Commit crash regressions as fixed-input unit tests in `tests/next/`.

### Phase 3 — CoW array storage in Value (M1; top memory win)

`VtArray::_DetachIfNotUnique` analogue: store `std::shared_ptr<XxxArrayStorage>`
in the SBO slot instead of a raw owning pointer. Copy = atomic refcount bump.
Non-const accessors (`as_float_array()` mutable, `raw_data()` mutable) detach
(clone when `use_count() > 1`) **and `mark_dirty()`** — the crate writer's verbatim
block pass-through keys off `is_dirty()`, so detach-without-dirty would corrupt
output. `move_from` and `MakeXxxArray(vector&&)` unchanged.

Gate: `bench_lazy_mem eager` should approach `lazy` for the clone portion;
`next_test_usdc_roundtrip` / `next_test_usdcat_roundtrip` green.

### Phase 4 — pcp speed: memoization + interned keys + graft fix (M2, M3, M5)

1. Memoize `FindSpecs` per `(stack_idx, interned site-path id)`:
   `unordered_map<uint64_t, vector<SpecRefIdx>>` where `SpecRefIdx =
   {const PrimSpec*, uint16 layer_idx}` (derive `layer_id` from
   `LayerStack::layer_identifiers[layer_idx]` instead of copying). Reuse across
   `AnyAuthors` / `ComputePrimIndex` / `ComposeInto` / instance-key computation.
   Invalidate together with `sources_cache` (rides existing `Invalidate` paths).
2. Convert hot pcp maps to interned u32 ids using the existing `InternPath` table:
   `Site` → `{uint32 layer_id_idx, uint32 path_idx}`; `index_cache`/`sources_cache`/
   payload/prototype maps keyed by interned root-path id; `Src::site` → u32.
   `MergeWorkerIndex` already remaps interned indices, so the worker path extends
   naturally.
3. `GraftSubtree`: walk the source subtree via `child_indices_` from
   `prim_at_path(src_root)` instead of a full-layer prefix scan. **Preserve the
   grafted-prim output order** (crate output determinism; roundtrip tests gate).
   `arc_resolved_`/`graft_paths_` `std::set<string>` → `unordered_set` / interned ids.

### Phase 5 — Instancing completeness (S4, I1–I4)

1. Instance key correctness (OpenUSD `PcpInstanceKey`/`Usd_InstanceKey` as truth):
   - Key variant content stacks by `(owning stack identifier, site, variantSet,
     variantName)` — kills the pointer key (S4).
   - Include the full accumulated variant-selection map and `Src.offset` in the key.
   - Deferred payloads already contribute no `Src`, so load state correctly splits
     keys — add a test (load one of a pair → prototypes split; load both → re-merge).
   - Strongest-opinion `instanceable` resolution; `instanceable` becomes tri-state
     in `PrimSpecMeta` (parser change: authored `false` ≠ unauthored).
2. Path translation API for consumers (Tydra): **DONE** —
   `Cache::TranslatePathToPrototype(path)` (longest registered instance prefix,
   recurse for nesting, iteration-capped) returns empty when `path` is under no
   instance; `TranslatePathFromPrototype(proto_path, instance_root)` is the
   single-instance inverse. `src/next/pcp/cache.{hh,cc}`.
3. Nested-instancing tests: **DONE** — `test_pcp.cc:test_path_translation`
   covers prototype-within-prototype (two-level rewrite through both prototype
   roots), recompose identity consistency, and empty-on-no-instance exclusion.
4. Port the PointInstancer compute API: **DONE** —
   `src/next/schema/geom-point-instancer.{hh,cc}` provides `GetPrototypes`,
   the instance arrays, `ComputeInstanceTransforms(time)`, and
   `ComputeMaskAtTime(time)` (per-instance visibility from `invisibleIds` +
   `inactiveIds`, id-mapped via `ids`); same preliminary limitations (velocities
   ignored, orientations held). Bounds/length mismatches return empties, not UB.
   Covered by `tests/next/test_schemas.cc:test_point_instancer_schema`.
   Security: `protoIndices[i] < prototypes.size()` and array-length mismatches →
   error, not UB. Shared fixture `tests/usda/pointinstancer-expand-001.usda`,
   numeric parity with the legacy test asserted from `tests/next/test_pointinstancer.cc`.

Gate: the serial/parallel prototype-grouping parity test re-run (key format changes
which prims share prototypes).

### Phase 6 — Lazy payload LoadRules (S7 + load-rules model)

OpenUSD analogue: `pxr/usd/usd/stageLoadRules.h` (sorted `(path, All|Only|None)`
rules with ancestor/descendant resolution) + `PcpCache::_includedPayloads`.

1. New `pcp/load-rules.{hh,cc}`: exception-free `LoadRules` port
   (`GetEffectiveRuleForPath` via binary search + ancestor scan, `Minimize()`).
   ~200 LOC, independently unit-tested against the OpenUSD truth table.
2. Replace `payloads_force_loaded/_unloaded` with one `LoadRules`;
   `ShouldLoadPayload` falls back to `payload_policy`/`load_payloads` when no rule
   matches. `LoadPayload(p)` ≙ `AddRule(p, AllRule)` so existing tests pass unchanged.
3. `LoadPayload(path, WithDescendants|WithoutDescendants)` / `UnloadPayload` /
   `SetLoadRules(rules)`; each computes the changed-path set and invalidates only
   those subtrees (rule-delta-driven recompose granularity).
4. Deferred-set lifecycle fix (S7): `ExpandArcs` returns discovered deferred sites;
   `ComputePrimIndex` commits them. `UnloadPayload` recomposes so
   `HasDeferredPayload` is immediately truthful. **Prerequisite for Phase 9.**
5. Payload-on-instance semantics, tested: loading a payload on instance I2 whose
   key-equal sibling I1 is the prototype splits I2 from the group; unload re-merges.

### Phase 7 — Composition correctness: list-edits, offsets, typed errors (S5, S6)

1. **ListOps (S5)**: `PrimSpecMeta` arc fields become
   `ListOp { explicit_, prepended, appended, deleted, ordered; bool is_explicit; }`.
   Parser routes the already-tokenized qualifier; bare `references = [...]` ⇒ explicit.
   Crate reader maps crate ListOp fields. New `ApplyListOps(strong→weak)` helper
   applied **per layer stack** in `ExpandArcs` (weakest-first per AOUSD §10.3.2) —
   also fixes the latent double-expansion of an arc authored identically in two
   sublayers. Behind `CompositionOptions::apply_list_ops = true`; review the corpus
   flatten diff once (Phase 2 gate is the safety net).
2. **Layer offsets (S6)**: parse sublayer `(offset = ..; scale = ..)` into layer
   metadata and arc offsets into `CompositionArc`; compose `offset·scale` through
   `ProcessArc`; include in the instance key (Phase 5 reserves the slot); apply at
   value resolution — BuildStage path first (per-arc-chain offset, fixing the
   one-offset-per-prim approximation), `attribute-eval` time remap
   `t → (t − offset)/scale` after.
3. **Specialize corners (E3)**: tests for specialize chains (A⇒B⇒C weakest-of-all),
   implied-inherit-discovered-under-specialize containment (audit
   `cache.cc:459-472` target routing), variant-internal arcs. Document relocates
   scope (same-parent rename only) in `doc/pcp.md`.
4. **Typed errors (E4)**: `enum class ErrorCode : uint8_t { ArcCycle, SublayerCycle,
   MaxDepthExceeded, InvalidAssetPath, UnresolvedPrimPath, IndexCapacityExceeded,
   InvalidVariantSelection, InvalidReferenceOffset, ... }` +
   `struct CompositionIssue { ErrorCode code; std::string site, message; }`
   accumulated on `Impl`; the existing `std::string *err` is rendered from it
   (no API break); tests assert on codes instead of message substrings.

### Phase 8 — Memory: PrimSpec footprint, token pool, mmap, lazy coverage (M4, M6–M8)

1. `PrimSpecMeta` split: keep `active/hidden/instanceable` + the 4 arc fields
   inline; move `variantSets`, `variantSelections`, `relocates`, `apiSchemas`,
   `doc`, `comment`, `instance_prototype` behind a lazily-allocated
   `unique_ptr<PrimSpecMetaExt>`. Relationships keyed by `PropNameId`
   (precedent: `connections_` already is). `Layer::finalize()` shrink_to_fit on
   `prims_`, `child_indices_`, slots. Expect 2–3× per-prim fixed-cost reduction
   (most prims have no relationships/variants/timesamples).
2. Token pool (TfToken-lite): `tokens_` = `{std::string blob; std::vector<uint32_t>
   offsets;}` — no per-token string; intern property names straight from the pool;
   optionally a token-index array storage (`vector<uint32> ids` + pool ref)
   materialized on demand.
3. mmap-backed `CrateDataSource` (posix first; OpenUSD `_MmapFile` analogue):
   second backing mode `{base, size, MmapHandle}`; `CrateReader::ReadFromFile`
   picks mmap when available. `StreamReader` is already `(base,size)` +
   bounds-checked, so the reader body is untouched; lazy values hold
   `shared_ptr<CrateDataSource>` so lifetime is already correct. WASM keeps the
   owned-string path. Bounds checks must remain (hostile concurrent writer).
4. Preserve the expanded lazy-array surface (Vec4f/Quatf, half arrays,
   Vec2-4d/Quatd/Matrix2-4d, and TimeSamples sample values) with regression
   tests. String/token arrays stay eager because they require table remapping;
   unsupported compressed/unknown layouts must remain non-pass-through
   (`block_len=0`) until their exact byte layout is implemented.

### Phase 9 — Multithread-readiness: minimal locking (T1–T3; land last)

No TBB; C++14 only; everything behind `LIGHTUSD_ENABLE_THREAD` macros that compile
to nothing when OFF. Sub-steps independently landable with the big lock as fallback
(`LIGHTUSD_NEXT_FINE_LOCKS` escape hatch during bring-up).

1. **LayerRegistry parallel parse (T2; biggest practical win, independent):**
   per-key `map<string, shared_future<shared_ptr<Layer>>>` under a small mutex;
   first requester inserts a promise and parses **outside** the lock; others wait
   on the future.
2. Enforce immutable-after-publish layers: registry hands out
   `shared_ptr<const Layer>`; audit that the pcp path never mutates fetched layers.
3. Append-only shared tables: `layer_stacks`/`path_table` → `std::deque` (stable
   addresses), small append mutex, `std::atomic<uint32_t>` published-size with
   release/acquire.
4. Index/sources maps: `std::shared_timed_mutex` (shared lookup, unique insert) +
   in-flight `unordered_map<id, shared_future<const PrimIndex*>>` so concurrent
   requests for the same prim build once.
5. Instance registration: builds return `(instanceable, key)`; a small locked
   `AssignPrototype` commits in deterministic publication order (generalizes the
   existing deferred mode, `cache.cc:362-368`).
6. Writers (`Invalidate`/`InvalidateLayer`/`LoadPayload`/`UnloadPayload`/`BuildStage`)
   stay exclusive; drop the *recursive* mutex by delegating public methods to
   lock-free `*_locked` internals.
7. TSAN stress tests in `tests/next/test_pcp_parallel.cc` (build/next-tsan):
   contended same-prim `ComputePrimIndex`; queries racing `Load/UnloadPayload` on
   disjoint subtrees; concurrent first-touch of one referenced layer; concurrent
   key-equal instance registration (prototype determinism); `Invalidate` racing
   queries. **Opt-in only — TSAN tests are never enabled by default (project policy).**

### Phase 10 — Exploratory: prim-index-backed lazy Stage (M9)

`ComposedPrimCache` inside `pcp::Cache`: per-prim composed spec built on **first
access** (reusing `ComposeInto`) instead of eager whole-stage `BuildStage` for
read-only consumers; `attribute-eval` gains a `(pcp::Cache*, Path)` entry point.
`BuildStage` remains for the flatten/write pipeline. Highest risk (new API,
invalidation coupling, thread-safety) — only after Phases 3, 4, and 9.

## 3. Dependency summary

| Phase | Depends on | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | — | baselines before any change |
| 1 | — | restructures ProcessArc/ExpandArcs signatures used later |
| 2 | 1 | so fuzzing doesn't trivially re-find Phase 1 holes |
| 3 | — | shared_ptr refcount is atomic → thread-friendly by construction |
| 4 | 1 (frame chain) | MergeWorkerIndex remap pattern reused |
| 5 | 4 helpful (interned ids in keys) | key change gated by serial/parallel parity |
| 6 | 5 (key/load-state tests) | D-step 4 is a Phase-9 prerequisite |
| 7 | 2 (corpus diff net) | ListOps changes composed output |
| 8 | 3 (CoW), 2 (fuzz for mmap/token pool) | |
| 9 | 6.4, 5.1 (mutation-free queries) | sub-steps landable individually |
| 10 | 3, 4, 9 | exploratory |

## 4. Measurement & verification protocol

- Per phase: `cmake --build <next-build> -j16 && ctest --output-on-failure`
  (all `next_test_*`).
- Memory: `bench_lazy_mem` (4 numbers), `mem_stats` sizeofs, WASM flatten memlog
  (`after-read` / `after-compose` / `after-write`), massif — deltas vs the Phase-0
  table recorded in `doc/memory-and-performance.md`.
- Speed: new pcp compose bench + `benchmark_next`.
- Robustness: ASAN build for Phase-1 crash tests; each fuzzer ≥1h locally after
  Phase 2; `corpus-parse-next` with `USD_WG_ASSETS_DIR` set.
- Threading: `build/next-tsan` with `LIGHTUSD_NEXT_ENABLE_THREAD=ON`; stress tests opt-in.
- Determinism: `next_test_usdcat_roundtrip` + serial/parallel grouping parity guard
  Phases 4/5/9.

## Phase 2 results (fuzzers + corpus gate)

Three libFuzzer harnesses (`LIGHTUSD_NEXT_BUILD_FUZZERS=ON`, clang) +
`next_usdcat` CLI + `next_corpus_parse` CTest gate. The fuzzers found **7
crashes** in the first minutes, all now fixed and pinned by
`tests/next/test_crash_regressions.cc` (replayed under ASAN/UBSAN):

1. `value-parser.cc:508` — `std::string(GetTypeName(id))` with `id` lacking
   TypeInfo → `std::string(nullptr)` abort. (USDA + compose.)
2. `crate-reader.cc` ReadFields token-indices — `memcpy(dst+8, v.data(), 0)`
   with empty vector → null-arg UB.
3. `crate-format.cc:457` DecodeIntegers — attacker-controlled `common_bytes`
   (up to 255) → out-of-range `<< (i*8)` shift UB. Reject `> 4`.
4. `stream-reader.hh:90` `read()` — zero-count `memcpy` with null src/dst UB
   (both overloads).
5. `crate-reader.cc` ReadFields value-reps — zero-count `memcpy` after decode.
6. `crate-reader.cc` ReadTokens — unterminated token blob → `strlen` reads past
   the decompressed buffer (heap-buffer-overflow). Now `memchr`-bounded.
7. (re-found #1 via the compose path before relink.)

Post-fix soak (clang, ASAN+UBSAN): USDA 590k runs, USDC ~bil runs across
sessions, compose 1.86M runs — all clean.

Corpus gate (`next_corpus_parse`, usd-wg/assets, 280 files): **0 FAIL /
0 CRASH** — every corpus file now loads (a few USDC files still report
warnings on unsupported binary value types). Registered as a regression
ratchet (`--max-fail 3`, `src/next/CMakeLists.txt`); the ratchet replaced
the original `--max-fail 220` baseline (15 PASS / 46 WARN / 219 FAIL) as the
list-op qualifier, dictionary-metadata, and compressed/extra array-type gaps
closed. Ratchet down further as remaining warnings close.
