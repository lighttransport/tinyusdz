# tusdrender — GPU backend testing (Vulkan / Direct3D 11 / HIP)

`tusdrender` (CPU preview ray-tracer, see
[`tools/tusdrender/README.md`](../tools/tusdrender/README.md)) has several optional
**GPU compute backends** that traverse the same LightRT BVH:

- **Vulkan** (`-vk` / `-vkr`) — `src/external/lightrt/lightrt_c_vk.c` +
  `lightrt_vkew.c`, driven by `tusdr_vulkan.cc`. Runtime-loaded via vkew (no
  Vulkan SDK to build), on by default (`-DTUSDRENDER_WITH_VULKAN=ON`). `-vkr`
  uses hardware ray tracing when present, else falls back to compute trace.
- **HIP/ROCm** (`-hip`) — `src/external/lightrt/lightrt_c_hip.c` +
  `src/external/hipew/hipew.c`, driven by `tusdr_hip.cc`. Runtime-loaded via
  hipew (opens `libamdhip64` + `libhiprtc`; no ROCm SDK to build), on by default
  (`-DTUSDRENDER_WITH_HIP=ON`, non-Windows). The trace kernel
  (`src/external/lightrt/hip/trace_bvh_hip.h`) is a **direct port of
  `trace_bvh.comp`** compiled at runtime with hiprtc, so it traverses the
  serialized LRTS BVH bit-for-bit identically to the Vulkan compute path
  (`-hip` ≈ `-vk`). Verified on AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT (gfx1201).
- **Direct3D 11** (`-d3d`) — `src/external/lightrt/lightrt_c_d3d11.cpp`, driven
  by `tusdr_d3d.cc`. Windows-only, on by default
  (`-DTUSDRENDER_WITH_D3D11=ON`); d3d11/dxgi/d3dcompiler ship with the OS, so no
  SDK is needed. Its compute shader (`d3d/shaders/trace_bvh.hlsl`) is
  **decompiled from the Vulkan SPIR-V with SPIRV-Cross**, so it traverses the
  BVH bit-for-bit identically; it just runs through the (much more mature on
  older AMD cards) D3D driver. Unlike the Vulkan helper it batches the whole
  frame's rays into **one** dispatch.

```sh
# CPU reference (always correct):
tusdrender models/suzanne-pbr.usda cpu.png -rtPreview -w 320 -height 240 -autoframe
# Vulkan compute trace:
tusdrender models/suzanne-pbr.usda vk.png  -vk  -w 320 -height 240 -autoframe
# Vulkan hardware ray query (RDNA2+; else falls back to compute trace):

# GPU shading mode. cpu is the current reference path; preview is accepted for
# upcoming fast GPU material preview and currently falls back to cpu with a log.

  -w 320 -height 240 -autoframe
# Large-scene preset for Vulkan batch/validation runs. Explicit backend, LOD,
# camera, and memory flags still win; texture resize/compression flags are not
# changed by the profile.

  -w 960 -height 540
# HIP/ROCm compute trace (AMD; kernel compiled at runtime via hiprtc):
tusdrender models/suzanne-pbr.usda hip.png -hip -w 320 -height 240 -autoframe
# Direct3D 11 compute trace (Windows):
tusdrender models/suzanne-pbr.usda d3d.png -d3d -w 320 -height 240 -autoframe
```

A correct GPU image must match the `-rtPreview` reference (same framed mesh).
The startup log prints the chosen device + path, e.g. `backend: LightRT VK
(compute trace)` / `LightRT D3D11 (compute trace, N rays in 1 dispatch)`.
GPU traversal is batched; the CPU-side BVH build and shade-after-hit stage honor
`-threads N` (`0` = hardware concurrency). On Vulkan hardware ray query (`-vkr`
with ray-query support), tusdrender skips the CPU LightRT BVH build and builds
the Vulkan acceleration structure directly from the flattened indexed geometry.
Successful `-vkr` ray-query renders log `ray_query, indexed Vulkan AS, CPU BVH
skipped`, which the GPU regression script checks. If the driver reports ray-query
support but AS build/trace fails, `-vkr` logs `compute trace, ray_query fallback`
and renders through the Vulkan compute path instead of returning a blank/failure.
Set `TUSDR_FORCE_VKR_FALLBACK=1` to exercise that fallback path in local tests.

## Fixed (was: "GPU backends mis-render") — 2026-06-28

The `-vk` / `-vkr` (and `-d3d`) backends previously mis-rendered — `-vk` a
**sparse, holey silhouette**, `-vkr` **fully blank** — while the CPU `-rtPreview`
was correct. This was first suspected to be an AMD **Radeon RX 570** / amdvlk
GCN/Polaris driver bug. Retesting on an NVIDIA **GeForce RTX 5060 Ti** (Linux,
driver `610.43.02`, Vulkan 1.4) reproduced the *exact same* symptoms — which
ruled out a vendor driver and pinned the fault to **CPU-side geometry/setup in
`tusdrender` itself**, not the GPU trace. Root causes (all now fixed):

1. **Polygons were not triangulated.** The GPU geometry collector in
   `tusdrender.cc` copied `faceVertexIndices` verbatim and the backends chunked
   it into groups of three. Suzanne is **468 quads + 32 tris**, so chunking the
   1968 indices by 3 produced 656 scrambled triangles instead of the 968 a proper
   fan-triangulation yields — hence the holes/sparseness. Fixed by triangulating
   with `faceVertexCounts` once, at collection (so `-vk`, `-vkr` **and** `-d3d`
   all get correct geometry).
2. **`-vkr` was fed the wrong vertices.** The ray-query BLAS expects a de-indexed
   triangle soup (9 floats/tri, `VK_INDEX_TYPE_NONE`), but `tusdr_vulkan.cc`
   passed the *indexed* unique-vertex array — over-reading and building garbage
   geometry, so every ray missed → blank. Fixed by expanding the indexed mesh to
   a soup before `lrt_vk_rtx_scene_build`.
3. **One GPU round-trip per pixel** (and, on `-vkr`, an acceleration-structure
   rebuild per pixel) made it minutes-slow at 320×240. Fixed by generating all
   primary rays and tracing the whole frame in **one batched dispatch** (build the
   AS once); 320×240 now finishes in well under a second.
4. **The GPU dispatch used a different camera** (the tilted auto-fit
   `MakeCameraFrame`) than `-rtPreview` (the `MakeUsdRecordCamera` record camera),
   so the same scene framed differently. Fixed by resolving the camera through the
   same path as `ResolveCameraNext`.

Verified on the NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti: `-vk` and `-vkr` now render the solid,
correctly-framed Suzanne (968 triangles, same dimensions as `-rtPreview`), and
the two paths agree to the byte (compute trace vs hardware ray query). The
`tool-tusdrender-smoke` ctest now asserts this — matching triangle count vs the
CPU reference, non-blank, matching dimensions, and `-vk` ≈ `-vkr` — see
`tools/tusdrender/check_tusdrender_smoke.py` (`check_vulkan`). The GPU path
flat-shades with geometric normals, so it is darker than the CPU image; that is a
shading-model difference, not a geometry error.

```sh
# A correct GPU image now matches the -rtPreview framing/silhouette:
tusdrender scene.usda cpu.png -rtPreview -w 320 -height 240 -autoframe
tusdrender scene.usda vk.png  -vk        -w 320 -height 240 -autoframe
tusdrender scene.usda vkr.png -vkr       -w 320 -height 240 -autoframe
```

### Debugging Vulkan with the Khronos validation layers

If a future change regresses the Vulkan path, the **Khronos validation layers**
give a definitive reason. Build/run them with the helper added for tusdview
(`scripts/setup-vulkan-validation.ps1 -FromSource` on Windows, or build from
source on Linux — see [`doc/tusdview.md`](tusdview.md)); the layer works for any
Vulkan app:

```sh
VK_LAYER_PATH=/path/to/Vulkan-ValidationLayers/build/layers \
VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation \
  tusdrender scene.usda vk.png -vk -w 320 -height 240 -autoframe 2>&1 |
  grep -E 'VUID|Validation'
```

Note the layer output (and tusdrender's own diagnostics) goes to stderr/stdout;
capture both streams.

## Per-instance LOD on the `-vk` / `-vkr` GPU backends (flatten-side)

`-rtLod` works on the `-vk` / `-vkr` / `-d3d` / `-hip` GPU backends too, applied
**flatten-side**: the same `tusdr_rt_lod` classifier runs once over the already
world-space-flattened `geos` (in `tusdrender.cc`, right after the camera resolves,
before the GPU dispatch). Each `geos[i]` is one world-space mesh placement, so its
world AABB is the classifier input (identity `o2w` + the world AABB as the
prototype bounds):

- **Cull** → drop the placement from the flat soup (fewer triangles to trace).
- **Proxy** → replace its triangles with an axis-aligned box on its world AABB
  (`BoxFitO2W`, a 12-triangle cube) — collapses a dense distant mesh to 12 tris.
- **Full** → keep the real triangles.

Opt-in via `-rtLod` (byte-identical when off); same tunables as the CPU path
(`-rtLodFullPx` / `-rtLodCullPx` / `-rtLodNoProxy` / `-rtLodFrustumCull`). With
`-stats` it logs `[rt-lod] flatten-side: full=… proxy=… culled=…`. Verified on a
120×(10×10-grid) receding scene: 24000 tris → 1440 (all-Proxy) → 624 (Proxy+Cull);
proxy renders the same silhouette coverage as Full.

**Limitation vs the CPU two-level path.** This is flatten-side, not a GPU TLAS, so:

- No per-prototype geometry/memory sharing — Full placements still cost their full
  triangle count in one flat BLAS (the win is *fewer/cheaper* placements, not
  shared BLAS memory).
- It only sees what the GPU collector emits. `CollectRTPreviewMeshesNext` now
  **expands both `PointInstancer` and scenegraph (`instanceable`) native
  instances** in place (`expand_instancers=true` on the GPU flatten caller; see
  *Instancing on the GPU backends* below), so instanced geometry renders and LODs
  here. Flatten LOD therefore covers many-separate-`Mesh` scenes (Caldera's 10k+
  districts), PointInstancer scatters, and native-instanced subtrees alike.

### Instancing on the GPU backends (flatten-side expansion)

`CollectRTPreviewMeshesNext(..., expand_instancers=true)` — set by the GPU flatten
caller in `tusdrender.cc` — expands instancing into world-space `MeshJobNext`
placements instead of stopping at it:

- **`UsdGeomPointInstancer`** (`ExpandPointInstancerJobsNext`): for every visible
  instance (`invisibleIds` skipped) compose `prototype-local · InstanceTRS(pos,
  orient,scale) · instancer-world` and bake the prototype's meshes at that
  transform. Mirrors the CPU two-level `CollectPointInstancer` math (`InstanceTRS`,
  same prototype resolution by child-name then stage path).
- **Scenegraph native instances** (`ExpandNativeInstanceJobsNext`): a prim with
  `instance_prototype` meta is a proxy; bake the prototype's geometry
  (`CollectExpandedProtoJobsNext`, prototype-local) at the proxy's world transform.
  Mirrors the CPU `CollectSceneSplit` native-instance branch.

Both share `CollectExpandedProtoJobsNext` (prototype-local collection with nested
instancers expanded recursively). By default these expansions **flatten** to the
single GPU BLAS (`expand_instancers` defaults to **false**, so the two-level proto
collectors `CollectProtoJobs` stay byte-identical), which duplicates a prototype's
geometry per instance. For instanced scenes the `-vkInstanced` two-level path below
shares that geometry instead.

### `-vkInstanced`: true two-level GPU TLAS (per-prototype BLAS sharing)

`-vkInstanced` (implies `-vkr`) builds a genuine two-level acceleration structure:
**one BLAS per prototype** (geometry stored on the device ONCE) and **one TLAS
instance per placement** (the same prototype BLAS referenced under a per-instance
transform). Instanced geometry costs one BLAS, not one-per-instance — the memory
the flat path could not save.

How it reuses the existing trace **with no shader/SPIR-V change**: LightRT's
ray-query backend already builds a TOP_LEVEL TLAS over BLAS and the shader already
recovers the hit id as `instanceId*tri_chunk + primitiveIndex`. The new C API
`lrt_vk_rtx_scene_build_instanced` (`src/external/lightrt/lightrt_c_vk.{h,c}`) sets
`tri_chunk` to the max prototype triangle count and builds one BLAS per prototype +
a TLAS instance per placement (real transforms). The returned `prim_id` then
decodes as `instance = prim_id / stride`, `prototypeLocalTri = prim_id % stride`.
tusdrender groups the expanded `mesh_jobs` by source prim path into shared
prototypes + placements (`TryRunInstancedVk` in `tusdrender.cc`), and the CPU hit
resolver (`ShadeAndWriteImageInstanced` in `tusdr_gpu_common.cc`) decodes the
instance, looks up the prototype-local triangle, and transforms the object-space
normal by that instance's normal matrix (cofactor of the 3×4, so non-uniform scale
is exact).

A prototype larger than the per-BLAS chunk limit (8M triangles; overridable via
`TUSDR_INST_CHUNK_TRIS` for testing) is **chunk-split** into sub-prototypes of ≤
chunk triangles (vertices remapped per chunk, shading slices carried along), and a
placement of it is emitted once per sub-proto. Each sub-proto is just a smaller
prototype, so the `pid` encoding and hit decode are unchanged; this works around
drivers (RADV) whose AS build-size query overflows for very large single-BLAS
builds. Verified pixel-identical (MAD 0.000) to the unsplit render by forcing a
small chunk on the demo prototype (1200 tris → 24 sub-protos, 7200 instances, still
1200 unique tris stored).

Opt-in (`-vkInstanced`), falls back to the flat path when ray query is unavailable,
there are no shareable instances, or `ninsts*stride` would overflow the 32-bit
`prim_id` encoding (`stride` = max sub-prototype triangle count, so a huge prototype
chunked small still caps total instances). Validated **pixel-identical** to the flat
`-vkr` path (luminance MAD 0.000/255, silhouette IoU 1.000) on a 200×(800-tri)
PointInstancer (BLAS stores 800 tris vs 160 000 flattened — 200× smaller), a
4-instance orient/non-uniform-scale PointInstancer, and a 3-tree `instanceable`
scene. `UsdPreviewSurface inputs:displacement` IS applied (per prototype, in object
space — `ExtractProtoGeo` resolves the bound material's constant + scalar texture
and offsets along the area-weighted smooth normal, like the flat extractor);
verified pixel-identical to the flat path with displacement on, and the displaced
silhouette grows as expected.

#### `-vkInstanced` + `-rtLod`: per-instance LOD on the two-level TLAS

`-rtLod` composes with `-vkInstanced` and applies the `tusdr_rt_lod` Full/Proxy/Cull
selection at the two-level build — the structure LOD is actually designed for (real
per-instance TLAS selection, not the flatten-side approximation). After the camera
resolves, `TryRunInstancedVk` classifies each placement from its prototype's local
AABB + transform: **Cull** drops the instance (absent from the TLAS), **Proxy**
points it at a shared unit-box prototype (built once, 12 tris) via a `BoxFitO2W`
transform onto the prototype's local AABB (a near-zero AABB axis is padded so a
planar/linear prototype still yields a box that traverses — a zero-thickness box
collapses to degenerate triangles and a per-proxy BLAS, unlike a flat soup, then
returns no hits), **Full** keeps the real prototype BLAS. Same knobs as the CPU /
flatten paths (`-rtLodFullPx`/`CullPx`/`NoProxy`/`FrustumCull`); `-stats` logs
`[rt-lod] two-level: full/proxy/culled`. The box BLAS is stored ONCE and shared by
every proxy, so LOD keeps the memory win. Validated on a 200-instance scene: each of
Full-only, Proxy-only (proxy box pixel-covers the mesh, IoU 1.000), Cull-only, and a
Proxy+Cull mix; the 3D-cube proxy matches the Full silhouette exactly. If every
instance culls, it falls back to the flat path.

The GPU-instancing path is now feature-complete: render PointInstancer + native
instances, per-prototype BLAS sharing, per-instance LOD (flatten-side and
two-level), displacement, and >8M-triangle prototype chunking — all reusing
LightRT's existing ray-query shader (no SPIR-V change).
