# Renderer benchmarks: lusdrender & lusdview

Two companion benchmark collections for the rendering stack:

- **Part 1 — Moana Island per-element** (`lusdrender` vs. `usdrecord`/hdEmbree):
  the island-scale, tens-of-millions-of-instances scenes that need streaming and
  view-dependent LOD.
- **Part 2 — Middle-scale public scenes** (`lusdview`): single rooms / properties
  that load and render interactively with the default flags.

The large-scene budgeting/LOD design and the Activision Caldera methodology live
in [`large-scene.md`](large-scene.md) and
[`tools/lusdrender/README.md`](../tools/lusdrender/README.md).

# Part 1 — Moana Island per-element benchmark — lusdrender vs. usdrecord (hdEmbree)

A head-to-head of lusdview's `lusdrender` (LightRT BVH + the `next` lazy USDC
loader) against Pixar's `usdrecord` driving the CPU **hdEmbree** Hydra delegate,
on the **independent per-element geometry** files of the Disney Moana Island
scene (`/mnt/disk1/data/island`). This is the first pass — individual elements
only, not the full assembled `island.usda` (a deliberate follow-up).

Methodology mirrors the Activision Caldera benchmark in
[`tools/lusdrender/README.md`](../tools/lusdrender/README.md) and
[`large-scene.md`](large-scene.md).

## Methodology

* **Host:** AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X (16C/32T), 62.6 GB RAM. lusdrender auto
  memory cap ≈ 23.2 GiB (`min(32, 0.5·MemAvailable)`).
* **Resolution / framing:** `320×180`, `-autoframe` (matches Caldera).
* **Inputs:** each element's standalone `usd/elements/<name>/element.usda`
  (three-file `element → instance → geometry` pattern → `model.usd` + XGen
  `prepend payload` archives).
* **lusdrender:**
  `lusdrender <element.usda> out.png -rtPreview -stats -w 320 -height 180 -autoframe`.
  Load / triangle-stream / BVH-build / render seconds come from `-stats`; peak RSS
  and wall from `/usr/bin/time -v`.
* **usdrecord:**
  `usdrecord --renderer Embree --disableGpu --imageWidth 320 <element.usda> out.png`
  with `PYTHONPATH=$dist/lib/python LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$dist/lib
  PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME=$dist/plugin/usd`. usdrecord prints no stage breakdown, so
  only total wall + peak RSS are recorded.
* **Harness:** [`tools/lusdrender/bench_island.py`](../tools/lusdrender/bench_island.py)
  (reproducible; writes `results.json` + `results.md`).

*(Table refreshed 2026-06 on the current optimized build. Notable since the prior
refresh: the curve-build optimizations (slim curve storage, Morton-LBVH curve
build, parallel curve sub-BLAS, dropping the redundant per-segment TriInfo) cut
isIronwoodA1 2.39→0.92 s / 1.1 GB→835 MB; and an **O(1) `Stage::GetPrimAtPath`**
fix (it was re-deriving the prim index with an O(N) linear scan per per-mesh
material/texture lookup) cut isCoral's stream 2.47→0.62 s and total 8.2→6.4 s, and
helps every multi-mesh scene (Island full 73→66 s). The first-pass numbers are
preserved in git history.)*

`tris` = instance-expanded *triangle* count lusdrender traces (only the *unique*
prototype geometry is stored — isBeach's 4.09 B visible expand from 63 K unique
across 86 prototypes placed by 22.1 M instances; it excludes curve strands).
`speedup` = usdrecord wall ÷ lusdrender wall. ‡ = isIronwoodA1's heavy XGen is
*curves* (`xgBonsai_curves.usd`, 34 BasisCurves prims, ~3 M hair segments) ray-
traced as hair — its 0.89 s / 836 MB is the curve build, and it renders the
foliage usdrecord does (the bare-trunk-only usdrecord row is 0.58 s). The curve
path was optimized end to end: per-segment storage slimmed to endpoints + a
per-BLAS material (1.08 GB → 842 MB); the build switched from serial binned-SAH to
parallel Morton-LBVH; large prototypes split into sub-BLAS whose collapses build
concurrently; and the redundant per-segment `TriInfo` intermediate (~360 MB,
profiling showed it — not the read/transform — was the serial bottleneck) was
dropped, deriving endpoints straight from the points. Net **2.32 → 0.89 s
(−62 %)**, now 0.7× usdrecord. The residual is the parallel LightRT build/collapse.

> `CollectSceneSplit` skips their subtrees. This corrected isIronwoodA1
> (0.97 → 0.49 M tris, one tree) and isHibiscus (1.28 → 1.02 M).

## Full scene — `island.usda`

The assembled scene (all 20 elements, scenegraph instancing + XGen PointInstancers
+ BasisCurves, lit by the `islandsun.exr` DomeLight) renders directly from
`usd/island.usda` through the `shotCam` at 320×180:

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| visible triangles | **5.69 B** |
| unique stored | 56.6 M |
| instances | 22.8 M (46 PointInstancers) + 52 curve instances |
| BLAS | 263 |
| wall | **1 m 33 s** |
| peak RSS | **25.9 GB** (needs `-maxMem` raised above the default `min(32, 0.5·avail)` cap, which aborts cleanly) |

This is the payoff of the PointInstancer + curve work: the whole island composes
and ray-traces directly from raw USD — 5.69 B effective triangles dedup to 56.6 M
unique. The per-triangle footprint work (follow-up 4: 4 B `TriStore` + per-BLAS
`TriMat` table + compact 3×4-float instance placements) cut peak RSS from the
initial **44 GB → 25.9 GB (−41 %)** and wall from 2 m 18 s → 1 m 33 s
(byte-identical geometry). A `usdrecord` full-scene comparison is impractical on a single host
(production references use Hyperion/RenderMan render farms); the per-element table
above characterizes the two renderers.

## Large-scene refresh — Caldera / Island / ALab (2026-06, post-optimization)

A cross-scene snapshot on the **current build**, after the compose + BVH-build +
indexed-geometry optimization work: `next` PropNameTable freeze (lock-free reads),
`M_TOP_PAD` arena tuning (kills the per-prim `mprotect` storm), bounded-parallel +
intra-threaded BLAS build, and the indexed base-group geometry stream
(`lrt_tri_scene_build_indexed`: 1× unique verts + indices instead of a 3×-expanded
soup). Same methodology as above — `320×180`, `-rtPreview -autoframe`, geom-only
(no camera/lights), `/usr/bin/time -v` for peak RSS. Auto memory cap ≈ 24.6 GiB.

| scene | input | load s | stream s | bvh s | **total** | **peak RSS** | triangles |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ALab** `alab_set01` | techvar overlay set | 1.60 | 0.63 | 0.69 | **3.2 s** | **1.59 GiB** | 19.6 M / 10.8 M unique |
| **isCoral** | `element.usda` | 3.40 | 0.62 | 1.50 | **6.4 s** | **3.1 GiB** | 17.4 M |
| **Caldera** | `caldera.flattened.usdc` | 2.99 | 6.17 | 5.37 | **16.1 s** | **12.5 GiB** | 38.8 M |
| **Island (full)** | `island.usda` | 13.3 | 24.4 | 18.1 | **65.7 s** | **22.5 GiB** | 5.68 B inst / 53.8 M unique |

The optimizations generalize across the whole large-scene ladder, not just isCoral:

* **ALab** build **6.5 → 3.2 s (−51 %)**, peak **2.6 → 1.59 GiB (−39 %)** vs the
  prior recorded geom-only set run.
* **isCoral** **14.1 → 6.4 s** and **6.3 → 3.1 GiB** — bvh 4.0 → 1.5 s
  (bounded-parallel + intra-threaded), compose lost the `find()` rwlock contention
  (PropNameTable freeze) + the arena `mprotect` storm (`M_TOP_PAD`), and the stream
  dropped 2.5 → 0.6 s from the O(1) `GetPrimAtPath` fix.
* **Island (full)** nearly saturates the ~24 GiB graceful-abort cap (22.5 GiB) and
  completes rather than OOM-killing; its stream fell 31 → 24 s from the same
  `GetPrimAtPath` fix (many small instanced meshes). Geom-only `-autoframe` here vs
  the lit `shotCam` row above, so the two aren't directly comparable.

**ALab reproduction** needs the techvar overlay (2.3.0 ships placeholder meshes;
the real geometry is the separate `techvar_assets` package):

```sh
cd /mnt/disk1/data/alab/usd
cp -al ALab-2.3.0/ALab _merged_ALab            # hardlink farm (~0 extra space)
cp -alf techvar_assets/fragment/. _merged_ALab/fragment/
lusdrender _merged_ALab/entity/alab_set01/alab_set01.usda out.png \
    -rtPreview -stats -w 320 -height 180 -autoframe
```

### NamespaceMapping pooling — compose allocation lever (commit `48aef48d`, 2026-06-21)

Profiling the isCoral compose showed `basic_string` operations at **~12 % self**
(the largest aggregate, ahead of the geometry stream) — path-string churn, not
`Value` copies (only 0.43 %). A big slice is the per-source `NamespaceMapping`:
a non-identity mapping's two path prefixes are *shared* by every `Src` in the
subtree below an arc (children inherit the parent's mapping unchanged in the
source child-build), yet the build re-copied them per prim — ~280 K redundant
long-string copies on isCoral's 140 K reference/payload-backed prims. The fix
pools the mappings in the compose `Impl` and stores a 4-byte index on each source
(`Src.map` 64 B → `map_idx` 4 B; `Src` shrinks 136 → 128 B), so the bulk
child-build copies an int. New mappings are appended only in the serial arc
expansion; the parallel opinion fill only *reads* the pool (deque → stable
addresses, lock-free). **Byte-identical** (suzanne / isCoral / isIronwoodA1 /
isBeach / isPandanusA + full `island.usda` all unchanged; `next` 23/23; smoke).

Measured before → after on the same build (`-rtPreview -w 320 -height 180`;
`sources` = the serial `[next_build]` source-resolution phase via
`LIGHTUSD_NEXT_TIMING`; wall + peak RSS from `/usr/bin/time`):

| scene | input | `sources` ms | wall s | peak RSS | md5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **isCoral** | `element.usda` | 1739 → **1480** (−260) | 6.52 → **6.0** (−8 %) | ~3.07 GB (flat) | `d00a4931041f` |
| **ALab** | `_merged_ALab/entry.usda` | 1555 → **1360** (−195) | 4.14 → **3.77** (−9 %) | 1.95 → **1.80 GB** (−150 MB) | `3e526a58217e` |
| **Caldera** | `caldera.usda` | 572 → 571 (~0) | ~5.07 (~0) | ~3.49 GB (~0) | `563be5ec4d1d` |

The win scales with the number of prims under **non-identity** arc mappings:
solid on the two reference/payload-heavy scenes (isCoral 140 K prims; ALab ~3.3 K
prims / ~1.3 K payloads, which also sheds 150 MB resident from the smaller `Src`
and de-duplicated mappings), and a clean **no-op on Caldera** — it composes to
comparatively few prims, so most mappings are identity (`map_idx 0`, no pool
entry, nothing to dedup). No regression anywhere: with identity mappings the
pooled path is a strict 4-byte index copy. (This is the *tractable* allocation
lever; a parallel attempt at compose **path-interning** — int-keying the spec
cache — proved net-neutral because interning re-allocates the path it removes,
on this allocation-bound compose.)

## Analysis

**Light/medium elements (isNaupakaA → isDunesA, isHibiscus): clean lusdrender
wins.** 3–18× faster wall and ~2–12× lower peak RSS than hdEmbree. The
`next` loader's startup is sub-second and LightRT's preview BVH builds in tens of
milliseconds, where usdrecord pays a fixed Hydra/USD-stage + delegate spin-up
cost (~0.7 s floor even on the tiniest element) and carries a larger resident
footprint.

**isBeach — instancing pays off (2.9×).** 22.1 M instances → 4.09 B effective
triangles, but only 63 K unique are stored, so the two-level TLAS renders the
full XGen ground cover in **25 s / 7.5 GB** vs usdrecord's **73 s / 15.2 GB**.
The footprint here is the *instance bookkeeping*, not geometry: compacting
`InstanceRT` to a 3×4 float (48 B vs a 128 B `matrix4d`) and freeing the
collection-side instance lists before the TLAS build cut isBeach from 11.7 →
7.5 GB and 32 → 25 s (byte-identical). The wall is dominated by the TLAS build
over 22 M instances.

**isCoral — the geometry-bound case (0.6×, memory won).** The one element where
both renderers load the *same* heavy geometry without an instancing shortcut
(87.5 M triangles, six `isCoral_geo.usd` variants). Focus of a dedicated pass
(lineage: PropNameTable freeze, `M_TOP_PAD`, bounded-parallel + intra-threaded
BLAS build, the indexed geometry stream, and the O(1) `Stage::GetPrimAtPath`
fix — all described above): compose `find()` rwlock contention, the per-prim
arena `mprotect` storm, bvh 4.0 → 1.5 s, and — the biggest single step — an
**O(1) `Stage::GetPrimAtPath`**: it was re-deriving the prim index with an O(N)
linear scan over all 140 K prims on *every* per-mesh material/texture lookup,
~8% of the profile but far more in wall time (stream 2.47 → 0.62 s). Result:
**14.1 → 6.4 s and 6.3 → 3.1 GB peak — RSS *beats* usdrecord (3.1 vs 3.3 GB)**,
wall ~1.6× (6.4 vs 4.2 s). The residual is now **compose-dominated, not the
builder**: load ≈3.4 s (crate-read ~1.3 + string-keyed Pcp source resolution
1.75 serial) vs the BVH build's 1.5 s. The remaining levers are compose
path-interning (vs Pixar's interned `SdfPath`) and an Embree-class SIMD BVH
builder. **Memory won on both axes; build time ~1.6× and now a compose + builder
question, not pure builder.**

## Reproduce

```sh
python3 tools/lusdrender/bench_island.py \
    --island /mnt/disk1/data/island \
    --dist   /mnt/nvme02/work/lightusd-repo/OpenUSD/dist \
    --bin    build_ninja/tools/lusdrender/lusdrender \
    --out    /tmp/island_bench
# force a graceful-abort row by capping memory on the heavy element:

    --lightusd-extra='-maxMem 2' --skip-usdrecord
```

## Follow-ups

1. ~~**PointInstancer expansion** in the `-rtPreview` path.~~ **Done.**
2. ~~**Curve ray tracing** (BasisCurves/NurbsCurves) + curve-prototype
   instancing.~~ **Done** — see the curve note above.
3. ~~**Curve instancing dedup.**~~ **Done** — instanced curve prototypes are now a
   deduped **curve BLAS** (round hair) instanced through the same TLAS as meshes
   (`lrt_roundcurve_scene_build` returns an `lrt_tri_scene*` the TLAS accepts;
   `Blas` carries an `is_curve` tag + per-segment `curve_info`, resolved in
   `ResolveTLASHit`). Geometry is stored once, not baked per instance. (Instanced
   curves are treated as round; per-instance flat/ribbon curves are not separated.)
4. **isCoral footprint — profiled (bandwidth-bound) + material-table refactor
   done.** Thread-scaling (1→8→32 threads) showed **all three phases plateau at
   ~4.5–4.7 s by 8 threads on a 16C/32T host → memory-bandwidth bound, not CPU
   bound**, so footprint is the lever. **Done** — the instanced (TLAS) BLAS no
   longer store a 124 B `TriInfo` per triangle. Per-mesh material moved to a
   per-BLAS **`TriMat`** table (one entry per mesh-job); positions are read from
   the BLAS **vertex soup** (`Blas::vertices`, which LightRT aliases so it's
   already resident) and the normal recomputed at hit time, so the per-triangle
   record (**`TriStore`**) is just a **4 B `mat_id`** (down from 124 B). Combined
   to a full `TriInfo` in `ResolveTLASHit` via `CombineTriMat`. Per-material
   resolution is also cached. Result on isCoral: tracked buffers **4.92 →
   1.29 GiB**, peak RSS **6.5 → 4.85 GB**, and faster (14.9 → 12.8 s, confirming
   bandwidth-bound). **Byte-identical** renders (md5-verified on flat + TLAS +
   curve-instancing scenes). The flat/legacy path keeps full `TriInfo` (those
   scenes are small). Remaining gap to Embree's 3.2 GB / mature BVH is
   architectural.
5. ~~**Native-instance curve placement.**~~ **Done** — curves under a scenegraph
   (`instanceable`) prototype are now placed per native instance via the deduped
   curve BLAS (`ReserveCurveProto` shared by the PointInstancer and native-instance
   paths). isIronwoodA1's instanced copy now gets foliage too (verified visually).
   (isIronwoodA1's 2× trunk is a separate, pre-existing quirk specific to its nested
   payload+instanceable structure, not a general double-count.)
6. ~~**Full-scene `island.usda`** benchmark.~~ **Done** — see the Full scene
   section above.

# Part 2 — Middle-scale USD scene benchmarks (lusdview)

Companion to [`large-scene.md`](large-scene.md) (Moana Island / Activision
Caldera, tens-of-millions-of-instances scenes that need streaming + view-
dependent LOD just to fit) — Part 1 of this file covers the island-scale
head-to-head. This section collects **middle-scale** public USD datasets — single
rooms / single properties, hundreds of thousands of instances at most — that load
and render **interactively without** the large-scene budgeting flags. They are
useful regression / shading / framing references that sit between the small
`models/` fixtures and the island-scale scenes.

## Host

* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 3950X (16C/32T)
* **RAM:** 62 GiB
* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, 16 GiB VRAM
* **Build:** `build/lusdview` (release), `--frames N` headless captures.
  Headless forces the **Vulkan** backend; GL numbers are captured windowed
  under `xvfb-run`. Wall / peak-RSS from `/usr/bin/time -v`; `present` (GPU +
  readback, ms) from `LUSDVIEW_TIME_FRAME=1` (last settled frame — use
  `--frames ≥ 4` so the projected-radius focal length settles, see
  [`large-scene.md`](large-scene.md) §2.6.5).

## Datasets

| Scene | Source | License | On-disk | Up-axis |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Kitchen_set** | Pixar USD sample (`graphics.pixar.com/usd/downloads`) | Pixar USD Kitchen Asset EULA — **non-commercial testing only**, no redistribution | 287 KB root `.usd` + 5.3 MB `assets/` | **Z** |
| **Intel 4004 Moore Lane** (`v1.2.0`) | ASWF Digital Production Example Library ([dpel.aswf.io/4004-moore-lane](https://dpel.aswf.io/4004-moore-lane/)) | **ASWF Digital Assets License v1.1**, © Intel Corp. 2023 ([terms](https://dpel.aswf.io/4004-moore-lane/moore-lane-license/)) | 5.3 GB USD + 6.8 GB textures (~13 GB total) | Y |

Both are **local-only test assets** here (`/mnt/disk1/data/usd/...`), not bundled
with LightUSD. Note the two licenses differ materially:

* **Kitchen_set** — Pixar's EULA permits only non-commercial testing and
  **forbids redistribution**.
* **Moore Lane** — the **ASWF Digital Assets License v1.1** (DPEL) explicitly
  permits use for *"education, training, research, software and hardware
  development, performance benchmarking (including publication of benchmark
  results), or software and hardware product demonstrations,"* and allows
  redistribution **with the copyright notice retained**. Per the license, the
  asset is referred to here by its official name and the following notice applies
  to the derived images in this document:

  > 4004 Moore Lane USD scene © 2023 Intel Corp., used under the ASWF Digital
  > Assets License v1.1. https://dpel.aswf.io/4004-moore-lane/

So the benchmarking and the Moore Lane images below are within its terms; the
Kitchen_set capture is reproduced for non-commercial testing only.

## Kitchen_set (Pixar) — small interior, fully real-time

The classic Pixar kitchen: **1806 meshes, ~0.54 M triangles** (1.07 M after the
`--next` converter's triangulation), no point instancers. It is **Z-up** and an
*enclosed interior* — the auto-framer fits the whole bounding box, so a headless
capture shows the room shell from outside (the props are inside the walls); it is
best explored interactively by orbiting in. The `--next` lazy path frames it more
cleanly than the eager path (robust auto-frame, correct Z-up).

```sh

| `--next` VK raster | 1 / 1.07 M | 3.0 s | 0.72 GiB | < 2 ms |

Comfortably real-time on every backend; the wall time is dominated by parse +
device/pipeline init, not drawing. A good shading / Z-up / interior-framing
regression fixture. (The `Kitchen_set_instanced.usd` variant loads identically on
the eager path, which flattens USD native instancing; `--next` is needed to
preserve instancing.)

## Intel 4004 Moore Lane — single property, foliage-heavy exterior

A whole house + landscaped lot. The shipped entry point
`USD/MooreLane_ASWF_0623.usda` **sublayers** the point-instanced foliage
(`Instances/usd_pointInstances_0621.usd`, 223 MB) over the assembly, composing
via `--next` to **35 draws / 297,518 instances / 22.8 M unique tris** — but
**4.33 B *effective* tris** once instancing is expanded. This is the regime where
the per-frame [`--raster-lod`](large-scene.md#265-per-frame-view-dependent-raster-lod---raster-lod-lusdview)
pays off: a single exterior view can put **a billion** effective triangles in the
frustum.

The scene ships ~20 authored cameras (`MASTER_cameraExtended` plus
`cam_diningRoom_*`, `cam_livingRoomFireplace`, `cam_exteriorDrive`, …); frame them
with `--camera`. Interiors render near-black in the flat-shaded `--next` preview
(no scene lighting) — the **exterior** cameras are the useful headless shots.

```sh
M=/mnt/disk1/data/usd/Intel_mooreLane_v1_2_0/Intel_mooreLane/USD/MooreLane_ASWF_0623.usda
# Foliage-heavy exterior hero (40 GiB host cgroup, framing an authored camera):
systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=40G -p MemorySwapMax=2G \
  ./build/lusdview --headless --next --backend vk --camera cam_exteriorDrive \
    --max-tris 80000000 --frames 4 --screenshot moore_ext.png $M
# Same view, view-dependent LOD (collapse < 24 px to box proxies, drop < 1.5 px):
systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=40G -p MemorySwapMax=2G \
  ./build/lusdview --headless --next --backend vk --camera cam_exteriorDrive \
    --raster-lod --raster-lod-cull-px 1.5 --raster-lod-full-px 24 \
    --max-tris 80000000 --frames 4 --screenshot moore_ext_lod.png $M
```

Load is ~37 s (parsing 5.3 GB of USD), peak RSS ~5.4 GiB — fits the 16 GiB GPU
without any of the large-scene merge flags.

**Per-camera cost (VK raster, no LOD):**

| Camera | Visible / total instances | Drawn tris | `present` |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|-----------|
| `cam_diningRoom_01` (interior) | 7,302 / 297,518 | 118 M | ~779 ms |
| `cam_livingRoomFireplace` (interior) | 9,398 / 297,518 | 140 M | ~885 ms |
| `MASTER_cameraExtended` | 7,701 / 297,518 | 131 M | ~847 ms |
| **`cam_exteriorDrive`** (foliage) | **123,539 / 297,518** | **1.02 B** | **~5630 ms** |

**`cam_exteriorDrive` with `--raster-lod` (cull-px 1.5, full-px 24):**

| Mode | Full-detail instances | Drawn tris | `present` |
|------|----------------------|------------|-----------|
| LOD off | 123,539 | 1.02 B | ~5630 ms |
| LOD on (box proxies) | 1,715 | 102 M | **~655 ms** |

~**8.6×** faster present (5.6 s → 0.66 s), 10× fewer effective triangles, with the
near house + framing trees kept full-detail and only the distant foliage collapsed
to box proxies — visually near-identical:

| LOD off | LOD on (`--raster-lod`) |
|---------|--------------------------|
| ![Moore Lane exterior, full](images/midscale/moorelane-exterior-drive.jpg) | ![Moore Lane exterior, raster LOD](images/midscale/moorelane-exterior-drive-lod.jpg) |

The fully-composed single-file variant
`USD/MooreLane_ASWF_0621_fullComposition.usda` (3.8 GB ASCII) renders the same
content but parses much slower than the sublayered entry; prefer
`MooreLane_ASWF_0623.usda`.

## Takeaways

* Both scenes load and render **interactively with the default flags** — no
  `--max-draw-meshes` / `--max-gpu-mem` merge needed (contrast
  [`large-scene.md`](large-scene.md) §2.6.4). Kitchen_set is sub-second to draw;
  Moore Lane interiors are ~0.8 s/frame.
* Moore Lane's **exterior foliage** view is the one case that benefits from
  `--raster-lod` (1.02 B → 102 M effective tris, ~8.6× present), making it the
  natural middle-scale regression for the per-frame view-dependent LOD path.
* Use **`--next`** for both: it gives correct Z-up + robust framing on
  Kitchen_set and preserves the point-instanced foliage on Moore Lane.
