# Foreword

This document provides a formal specification of the core of the
Universal Scene Description (USD) data representation, and scene
construction algorithms.

This core specification describes the make-up of a scene description
document, how to read its associated file formats and compose the scene
description elements into a final stage. This document may be referred
to as the “USD Core Specification” , or just “the Specification” or “the
specification” hereafter.

This Specification is derived from the
[OpenUSD](https://www.openusd.org) project developed by Pixar Animation
Studios. References to OpenUSD in this Specification will specifically
refer to the open-source project itself to disambiguate from USD as
described in this Specification.

## Domain Specific Specifications

This Specification is focused on the core aspects of USD. It does not
describe domain specific uses of USD, such as:

- Geometry
- Materials
- Physics etc…

Domain specific uses of USD will be covered by other specifications
published by the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD).

## Document Conventions

The document uses the following keywords as described in [BCP
14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14).

- **MUST**
- **MUST NOT**
- **REQUIRED**
- **SHALL**
- **SHALL NOT**
- **SHOULD**
- **SHOULD NOT**
- **RECOMMENDED**
- **MAY**
- **OPTIONAL**.

Any references to external documents are considered normative if the
Specification uses any of the normative terms defined in this section to
refer to them, or their requirements, either as a whole or in part.

Some language in the specification is purely informative, with an
intention to give more clarity or suggestions for readers. If the
entirety of a section is informative, it will be labelled as
“Informative”, otherwise all sections must be considered normative.

All notes and examples are purely informative.

## Supplemental Materials

In addition to this specification, we provide sample implementations.
These will be made available at [aousd.org](http://www.aousd.org).

## Versioning

This specification is designed as version 1.0.1. Our document version is
similar to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) and uses the
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` pattern.

The entirety of this specification will be versioned together as a
whole, however the [file format sections](#core-file-formats) will also
include their own version information that corresponds with the
serialization version. The formats will list their own versioning
semantics as well.

Changes that would change compatibility with previous versions of the
specification will result in a MAJOR version changing.

The MINOR version will increase when the specification adds new
information while preserving backwards compatibility with prior MINOR
versions of the same MAJOR version.

PATCH versions will increase when there are corrections or changes to
this specification that do not necessitate a MAJOR or MINOR change.

PATCH versions that increment due to corrections may break compatibility
with prior PATCH versions of that MAJOR.MINOR release, if the spirit of
the corrections are intended to preserve the MAJOR.MINOR versioning
behaviour.

Please reference the [Changelog](#changelog) to see notable changes
between published versions. Changelogs will contain the changes relative
to the prior release within the same MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version family.

### Referencing this Specification

Other documents that reference this specification must concretely
specify the full version of this specification to help resolve any
divergence there may be between PATCH versions.

It is optional for documents referencing this specification to adopt
this specification’s versioning semantics, but those documents should be
aware of the compatibility differences as described above.

Documents that reference this specification must assume that they will
work with future PATCH version changes of this specification within the
specified MAJOR.MINOR version.

## Errata and Support

Despite our best efforts, this specification may contain errata , or may
require further clarifications.

We encourage readers to post on our forum at
[forum.aousd.org](https://forum.aousd.org) with any questions or
concerns that they may have.

As noted in the [Versioning](#versioning) section above, corrections
issued for errata will lead to a PATCH increment on the specification
version.

## Changelog

Notable changes to the document version are listed here for reference.

### 1.0.1

- Initial release of the specification.

# Introduction

Universal Scene Description (USD) is an authoring and interchange format
for representing 3D scenes. Its layered composition model enables
collaborative workflows and allows powerful ways to combine assets into
larger assemblies. This specification describes the way that data is
represented, authored, and composed into a final stage representing the
3D scene.

## Representation and Authoring

Scene elements are represented by *scene description* that is organized
into *scene description specifications*, hereafter referred to as
*specs*. Specs are organized hierarchically, with the *layer spec*
defining the root of the hierarchy and *prim*, *property*, *variant
set*, and *variant* specs defining the elements in that hierarchy.
Within a layer, specs are addressable via *paths*, which form the
addressable representation of a spec from root (the layer spec) to leaf
(the spec being addressed). Data is stored in specs via *metadata
fields*, and *authoring* is done by providing values for those fields on
the desired spec. The values provide *opinions* on the final value for a
*scene object*, a composite object formed by *composing* all opinions on
all specs at a given path when constructing the scene.

## Scene Construction and Composition

A *stage* is formed by *composing* all specs reachable from a *root
layer* into individual *scene objects*. The scene object representing
the root layer forms the addressable root of the resulting stage. All
specs reachable from the root layer are then composed to form the
analogous scene object representation inside of the stage; e.g., *prims*
and *properties*. The process of composition may result in opening
additional layers to obtain further opinions. The scene object, which
aggregates opinions on all specs addressable with the same path, has its
opinions ordered from the spec providing the strongest opinion to that
providing the weakest according to the strength ordering of its
associated *composition arcs*. Each scene object in the final stage is
also addressable via a path; that is, a path can be interpreted both on
a stage (referring to aggregate scene objects) and an individual layer
(referring to specs within that layer).

## Specification Structure

This specification normatively describes:

- the data model and algorithms necessary to represent the data
  associated with specs
- the algorithms used to compose those specs into scene objects in a
  stage
- the means to extend the data model to contain new data
- the representation of the data model in formats for interchange

The specification begins with the [foundational data
types](#foundational-data-types) by describing the types that can be
represented in USD and follows with the [document data
model](#document-data-model), specifying the data fields (and their
types) that represent the data model for each spec. Building on that
representation, the specification describes the methodology for
addressing the contents of a layer through [paths](#paths) and
[assets](#resource-interface). The specification then describes the
means for interpreting that data to [populate a
stage](#stage-population) with scene objects that are created by
[composing](#composition) the information in each spec contributing
opinions to that scene object. The specification discusses the
algorithms required to correctly resolve values from those scene objects
through [value resolution](#value-resolution). Finally, the
specification describes how to extend the data model via
[schemas](#schemas) and how to store that data in
[formats](#core-file-formats) suitable for interchange. At each step
along the way, the reader is encouraged to use the [glossary](#glossary)
as a reference for the nomenclature introduced throughout.

# Compliance

## Interpreting Compliance

An implementation of the specification may be understood to be in
compliance with the specification if the following are true:

- If the specification has a conformance test, and the implementation
  passes this conformance test.
- The result of checking compliance matches the written specification.
- If OpenUSD is checked for compliance on the same aspect, the same
  result is obtained as for the implementation.

## Compliance Ambiguities

If the specification does not contain language describing a particular
aspect, making interpretation necessary, the OpenUSD implementation
should be considered as the expected behavior. Any such circumstance
should be considered an unintentional omission in the specification, and
may be addressed by the release of Addenda, Errata, or new releases of
the specification.

## Compliance Disagreements

- If a specification provided unit test checks for a result that
  disagrees with the specification, one or both of them are in error.
- If an implementation yields a result that differs from the
  specification, the implementation is in error.
- If an implementation yields a result that differs from the
  specification but matches the OpenUSD reference behavior, then one or
  more of the following is in error: the unit test, the specification,
  or OpenUSD itself.

Any such condition of disagreement may be addressed by the release of
Addenda, Errata to the specification, new releases of the specification,
or updates to the OpenUSD implementation, as deemed most appropriate.

## Compliance Rubric

A compliant implementation of Universal Scene Description core
specification must pass the following conformance tests:

1.  Composed Stage Population
2.  Value Resolution
3.  Format Implementations (`usda`, `usdc`, `usd`, and `usdz`)

Conformance tests will be made available at
[aousd.org](https://aousd.org/).

### Composed Stage Population Compliance

Compliant implementations of composed stage population must populate a
stage of composed scene graph objects (prims and properties) from the
set of compliance root layers. For validation, a “squashed” version of
the stage into a single layer will be provided. A “squashed” stage has
removed all composition operators. A valid implementation of composed
stage population produces the exact same set of a) scene graph objects
and b) authored field values as the “squashed” layer.

Floating point fields must be exact at authored time samples, and exact
at spline knots. Although interpolant methods such as linear
interpolation, bezier evaluation and others are common and allowable,
they are not subject to specification or compliance validation at the
time of this writing.

> *Note:* Squashing of composition operators may produce different
> results if the squashed layer is included via `reference`, `payload`,
> or `subLayers` into another stage because instancing and variant sets
> are dependent on presence of arcs.

### Value Resolution Compliance

Compliant implementations of value resolution must sample values on
scene graph objects into a “sampled” layer. A valid implementation of
composed stage population produces the exact same set of a) scene graph
objects and b) authored field values as the “sampled” layer.

Compliant implementations of metadata values must encode the fallback
values from either a prim definition or the document data model
explicitly into the sample layer. This addresses value resolution of
`relationship` target paths.

Compliant implementations of attribute value resolution must negotiate
between `default`, `timeSamples`, `spline`, and `clips` and sample the
results at specified times. A “sampled” stage removes the `spline` field
and replaces `timeSamples` with interpolated values and `default` with
the authored `default` value or an attribute’s fallback value. For
integral and string typed attributes, the value resolution must be
exact.

Floating point fields must be exact at authored time samples, and exact
at spline knots. Interpolated values between exact values may deviate a
small amount from an evaluation of the reference interpolator if no
other evaluation subject to the exact value requirement is perturbed.

> *Note:* Resampling a stage may produce different results when consumed
> as the sampling frequency is being changed and extremes may be elided.
> Resampling as defined here is for validation.

### Format Implementation Compliance

Compliant implementations of the `usda`, `usdc`, `usd`, and `usdz`
formats must be provided. Formats implementing the document data model
must produce the same set of specs and authored metadata fields and
values as the compliance test.

# Glossary

This glossary captures technical terms and definitions used in the USD
core specification.

## Core Terms

### Asset

Resource or container of resources (layers, textures, volumes, etc.)
providing the data for a scene.

### Attribute

A type of Property meant for holding forms of numeric, string, and array
valued data. Data types can be scalar (single valued) or dimensioned
(arrays). Attributes can contain data that can vary over time.

### Authored/Unauthored

An authored Property or Metadata field provides values as opinions for
value resolution.

An unauthored field does not provide its own value but may contribute a
fallback value for value resolution.

### Composition

The process that assembles opinions for a scene object at a given Path
from multiple Layers together using Composition Operators to determine
the relative strength ordering of those opinions.

### Composition Operators

Layer features that provide instructions on how to combine data from
other sources. Those sources may exist in the same Layer, or may come
from another Layer. The shorthand notation for the different types (and
strength order) of composition is LIVERPS.

Operators which compose a subgraph into the local layer stack are more
specifically termed “composition arcs”.

### Core Specialized Type

A type that represents a higher-level data structure that cannot
otherwise be handled by a [foundational data
type](#foundational-data-types). For example, a Reference field is a
Core Specialized Type that has an Asset Path and a Prim Path.

### Document

A USD layer (see Layer).

### Fallback Value

A value for a property or metadata field that may be used by consumers
when that field has no value set (an “unauthored” field).

### Flatten

The process of combining all Layers in a Stage into a single Layer,
applying Composition and then removing [Composition
Operators](#composition-operators) so that a layer has no external
dependencies. A flattened stage may preserve or introduce internal
composition arcs to preserve behaviors such as instancing. See also
[squash](#squash).

### Format (Layer Format)

An implementation of the Layer document model. Formats are mappings from
storage to a hierarchy of specs and their Metadata fields.

### Inherits

A Composition Arc that aggregates scene description from a base Prim at
a scene graph location. Unlike a Reference, Inherits arcs will aggregate
opinions from the specified scene graph location through all levels of
referencing.

### Kind

Prim level metadata used to provide classification of Prims necessary
for scene and asset management.

### Layer

A fundamental container that contains zero or more hierarchical Prim
elements of a Scene.

### Layer Stack

The ordered set of Layers resulting from the recursive gathering of all
Sublayers of a Layer, plus the Layer itself as first and strongest.

### List Ops

List Operations, or ListOps, are value representations of operations
(e.g. appended, deleted, prepended) that edit a list of items, producing
orderings of unique elements of the same type.

### LIVERPS

An acronym for the different Composition Operators in USD: Local,
Inherits, VariantSets, rElocates, References, Payload, and Specializes.
The acronym lists the strength ordering for how Composition composes
Opinions and Namespaces.

### Local

A Composition Operator that simply acquires Opinions from the local
Layer Stack, including Sublayers.

### Metadata

Lightweight name and typed value scene description data. Metadata cannot
contain data that can vary over time.

### Namespace

The set of Prim Paths that provide the identities for prims on a Stage,
or Prim Specs in a Layer.

### Opinions

Values specified in a Layer, commonly on Prim or Property specs.

### Path

Identifies a location within a namespace (such as a prim on a stage).
Paths in Universal Scene Description adhere to the [Path
Grammar](#paths).

### Payload

A Composition Arc that uses a target Path to aggregate scene data,
similar to References, but allows easy control over whether to load the
target scene data, enabling efficient handling of complex Scenes.

### Prim

A container object represented by a unique Path within the Namespace
hierarchy of a Stage that can contain a set of Properties. Prims also
serve as the site of Composition arcs, and as such can define
Composition arcs as part of its definition.

### Prim Spec

Contributor of values (opinions) for a Prim in a Layer.

### Property

A named data holder for a prim. Properties are the most granular data
holder in a USD Layer. There are two types of Properties: Attributes and
Relationships.

### Property Spec

Contributor of values (opinions) for a Property in a Layer.

### References

A Composition Arc that specifies a target Path and aggregates scene
description from that path into the referencing Layer. References may
point to a separate Layer, or to another Prim within the current Layer.

### Relationship

A Property that creates a dependency between scene objects by allowing a
Prim to target other Prims, Attributes, or Relationships.

### Relocates

A Composition Arc that maps a Prim Path defined across a Composition Arc
to a different Path in the local Namespace.

### Scene

A set of USD data organized for a specific purpose. More specifically, a
scene graph of Prims along with Metadata.

### Schema

An object that defines and applies semantic meaning to populated scene
elements via Properties, Metadata, and allowable behaviors. Schemas can
act as templates to apply meaning and categorization to Prims and
Properties.

### Schema domain

A grouping of related Schemas.

### Specializes

A Composition Arc that aggregates scene description from a base Prim at
a scene graph location. Unlike a Reference, Specialize arcs will
aggregate opinions from the specified scene graph location through all
levels of referencing. Behaves similar to the Inherits Arc except for

# Foundational Data Types

## Background

This section specifies common types used in Universal Scene
Description’s foundational data models \[1\]. These types are used
within the core file formats to encode information as serializations in
files and other persistent or dynamic storage. Composite types, i.e.,
higher-level data structures, are described elsewhere, with their
respective schemas \[2\]; this section declares the foundational types
from which composite types may be constructed.

## Scalar Types

Scalar types represent single values. In the table that follows, types
such as string are indicated. A string is considered a scalar type as it
is a sequence of characters, treated as a single unit. In this context,
the term “scalar” emphasizes that the string is a single value, as
opposed to a collection or composite type.

The integer types below are described as uN for an unsigned two’s
complement integer of N bits, and iN for a signed two’s complement
integer of N bits. Float types are described as fN where N is the number
of bits. The distribution of sign, mantissa, and exponent within those
bits is described in the noted IEEE standards.

| Type | Fundamental Type | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `asset` | utf8 encoded string, not containing C0 controls (U+0000..U+001F) nor C1 controls (U+0080..U+009F) | Asset identifiers are subject to variable substitution and [resolution to locate resources](#resource-interface) at runtime |
| `bool` | u1 | 0 is false, 1 is true |
| `double` | f64 | per IEEE 754-1985 |
| `float` | f32 | per IEEE 754 |
| `half` | f16 | per IEEE 754-2008 |
| `int` | i32 |  |
| `int64` | i64 |  |
| `string` | utf8 encoded string |  |
| `timecode` | f64 | A unitless value |
| `token` | utf8 encoded string | Expected amortized constant time hash and equality comparison |
| `uchar` | u8 |  |
| `uint` | u32 |  |
| `uint64` | u64 |  |

> *Note:* Values of type `token` are expected to be commonly used
> strings optimized for comparison and hashing. They often function as
> an alternative to an enumerated type. Note that the specification for
> `token` and `string` values is the same, but runtimes may choose
> different runtime and storage representations based on the expected
> usage.

## Dimensioned Types

Arrays are indicated with brackets containing the dimension of the
array, for example, f32\[2\] means an array of two f32 values as
described in the [Scalar Types](#scalar-types) section. f32\[3,3\] means
a two dimensioned array, in row-major order, such that f32\[i, j\]
indexes the element in the *i* th row and the *j* th column. If a
f32\[4, 4\] matrix contained a transformation matrix where the upper 3x3
indicated a rotation with no scale, then the translation would be found
in the fourth row; if the matrix were laid out linearly in a single
dimension array, row following row, the translation would be found in
the 13th, 14th, and 15th elements of that linear array \[3\].

Vectors are treated as row vectors when multiplied by a matrix. Vectors
pre-multiply matrices to effect transformations. Accordingly,
transforming a vector $`v`$ by a series of transformation matrices may
be written as $`v_t = v \cdot S \cdot R \cdot T`$

The quaternions are arranged as three imaginary coefficients, followed
by a single real coefficient. They are assumed to be normalized as they
are intended to be used as orientations, not general purpose complex
numbers. Quaternions are treated as right-handed, irrespective of the
handedness of the prim they are on. Similarly, matrix multiplication is
treated as right-handed wherever handedness is important; and cross
products may also be assumed to be right-handed whenever they are used
to compute an orientation.

## Algebraic Types

| Type | Notes |
|:---|:---|
| `opaque` | An algebraic type that is not serializable and not representable by other fundamental types |

## Semantic Aliases For Types

Semantic aliases are not foundational types but aliases that assign a
semantic role to a foundational type. Core value behaviors are only
predicated on the underlying type, but higher level constructs should
respect the semantics applied to values (such as using different
transform semantics to values with normal, point, and vector roles).

| Semantic Alias | Underlying Type | Role | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `color3d` | `double3` | color | RGB |
| `color3f` | `float3` | color | RGB |
| `color3h` | `half3` | color | RGB |
| `color4d` | `double4` | color | RGBA |
| `color4f` | `float4` | color | RGBA |
| `color4h` | `color4h` | color | RGBA |
| `normal3d` | `double3` | normal | (x, y, z), Unit length (advisory) |
| `normal3f` | `float3` | normal | (x, y, z), Unit length (advisory) |
| `normal3h` | `half3` | normal | (x, y, z) Unit length (advisory) |
| `point3d` | `double3` | point | (x, y, z) Indicates position |
| `point3f` | `float3` | point | (x, y, z) Indicates position |
| `point3h` | `half3` | point | (x, y, z) Indicates position |
| `vector3d` | `double3` | vector | (x, y, z) Indicates direction and length |
| `vector3f` | `float3` | vector | (x, y, z) Indicates direction and length |
| `vector3h` | `half3` | vector | (x, y, z) Indicates direction and length |
| `frame4d` | `matrix4d` | frame | 3-D Coordinate Transformation Matrix |
| `texCoord2d` | `double2` | texCoord | (x, y) |
| `texCoord2f` | `float2` | texCoord | (x, y) |
| `texCoord2h` | `half2` | texCoord | (x, y) |
| `texCoord3d` | `double3` | texCoord | (x, y, z) |
| `texCoord3f` | `float3` | texCoord | (x, y, z) |
| `texCoord3h` | `half3` | texCoord | (x, y, z) |
| `group` | `opaque` | group | A proxy for multiple values |

### Type and Alias Agreement

Comparisons between a semantic alias and an underlying type are
specified as “agreement”. An alias agrees with its underlying type.
`double3` and `color3d` are not equivalent but they do agree. Two
equivalent underlying types are considered trivially agreeable.

Agreement is specified for an alias and an underlying type or two
underlying types but not two semantic aliases.

## Container Types

### Arrays

Describe random access arrays of scalar and dimensioned types by
appending brackets (`[]`) to the type name. For example, a `float` array
is specified as `float[]`, a `double3` array is specified as
`double3[]`, and a `string` array is specified as `string[]`. An array
may be any non-negative size, including empty. Arrays of algebraic types
are not permitted.

Explicit size qualifiers are not used to restrict or specify the size of
an array. For example, `float[9]` may not be used to describe an array
of 9 floats. Describe sizes and restrictions using additional values or
fields.

For an array with size `n`, an index of `0` references the first
element, `1` references the second element, and `n - 1` references the
last element.

Index based access of arrays of dimensioned types should return the
entire dimensioned value.

#### Semantic Aliases and Arrays

A semantic alias may be annotated with brackets (`[]`) to indicate an
array of values, where each element conforms to the specified alias. For
example, `color3f[]` denotes an array of values of type `float3`, with
each element associated with the `color3f` semantic. Agreement of arrays
with a semantic alias is defined by the agreement of the alias with an
underlying element type. For example, `color3f[]` agrees with
`float3[]`.

### Dictionaries

A dictionary is an unordered map of strings to heterogenous values. Each
key maps to one and only one value. Dictionaries must support the
following as value types.

- Scalar types
- Dimensioned types
- Arrays of scalar or dimensioned types
- Dictionaries

They should not store semantic aliases for values. They should not store
list operations (see below).

Dictionaries containing other dictionaries are considered “nested”.

An empty string is a valid key but not recommended.

`dictionary` is the normative name of this container type.

#### Combining ($`\cup`$)

Combining of two dictionaries in the domain of dictionaries
$`\mathbb{D}`$ is a closed and associative operation.

A stronger dictionary `S` merged with a weaker dictionary `W` must
contain

- Key value pairs from `S` where the key is not in `W`’s keys
- Key value pairs from `S` where the key is in `W`’s keys but both
  values aren’t dictionaries
- For every key in both `S` and `W` where both values are dictionaries,
  a new key value pair with the dictionary values combined
- Key value pairs from `W` where the key is not in `S`’s keys

``` math
\begin{gathered}
\cup: (\mathbb{D}, \mathbb{D}) \to \mathbb{D}\\
S = \{(k_{s_0}, v_{s_0}), ..., (k_{s_n}, v_{s_n}) \}\\
W = \{(k_{w_0}, v_{w_0}), ..., (k_{w_m}, v_{w_m}) \}\\
\begin{aligned}
S \cup W \equiv
&\{(k_{s_x}, v_{s_x}) &&\forall (k_{s_x}, v_{s_x}) && \mid k_{s_x} \notin \{k_{w_0}, ..., k_{w_m}\}\} \cup \\
&\{(k_{s_y}, v_{s_y}) &&\forall ((k_{s_y}, v_{S_y}), (k_{w_y}, v_{w_y})) &&\mid k_{s_y} = k_{w_y} \wedge \lnot(v_{s_y}, v_{w_y} \in \mathbb{D})\} \cup \\
&\{(k_{s_z}, v_{s_z} \cup v_{w_z}) &&\forall ((k_{s_z}, v_{s_z}), (k_{w_z}, v_{w_z})) &&\mid k_{s_z} = k_{w_z} \wedge v_{s_z}, v_{w_z} \in \mathbb{D}\} \cup \\
&\{(k_{w_q}, v_{w_q}) &&\forall (k_{w_q}, v_{w_q}) &&\mid k_{w_q} \notin \{k_{s_0}, ..., k_{s_n}\}\} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{gathered}
```

### List Operations

List operations or “list ops” are values that produce user orderings of
unique elements of the same type.

Element uniqueness requires types that have robustly defined equality
operations. For performance, implementations may require a well-defined
hash function as well.

The following types (`int`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint64`, `string`, and
`token`) are fundamental data types that must be supported by list
operations. Floating point types should not be supported by list
operation.

The set of types that support list operation for the specification may
be extended to additional types (such as [scene object
paths](#speculative-objectpath-as-a-core-specialized-type)) to support
composition and other core features.

#### Shorthand

`listop<$TYPE>` may be used as shorthand to refer to a list op that
produces an ordering of elements of type `$TYPE`. For example,
`listop<int>` or `listop<token>`.

#### Definition

A single list operation $`L`$ in the domain of list operations
$`\mathbb{L}`$ is either “explicit” or “composable”.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{L} = \mathbb{L_{explicit}} \cup \mathbb{L_{composable}}\\
\mathbb{L_{explicit}} \cap \mathbb{L_{composable}} = \emptyset\\
\end{aligned}
```

List operations are compromised of subfields containing sequences of
user ordered unique elements. Notationally,
$`\langle a, b, c, ... \rangle`$ should be read as a sequence where the
user ordering of elements is important and $`\{a, b, c\}`$ should be
read as a set where ordering does not matter.

An explicit list operation $`E`$ holds a single explicit sequence of
unique elements or items.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
E \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}} &\equiv (explicit: \langle e_0, e_1, …, e_n \mid   e_x \notin \{e_0, …, e_{x-1}\}\rangle)\\
E &= (explicit: \langle1, 6, 5\rangle)
\end{aligned}
```

A composable list operation holds three unique operation sequences of
appended, prepended, and deleted items.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
C \in \mathbb{L_{composable}}  \equiv (&append:  &&\langle a_0, a_1, …, a_n &&\mid a_x \notin \{a_0, …, a_{x-1}\}&&\rangle ,\\
     &prepend: &&\langle p_0, p_1, …, p_n &&\mid p_x \notin \{p_0, …, p_{x-1}\}&&\rangle,\\
     &delete:   &&\langle d_0, d_1, …, d_n &&\mid d_x \notin \{d_0, …, d_{x-1}\}&&\rangle)
\end{aligned}
```

Uniqueness is scoped to each individual sequence component of a list
operation. The same element may appear in appended, prepended, and
deleted item sequences for the same list operation.

``` math
C = (append: \langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle, prepend: \langle 1 \rangle, delete: \langle 3 \rangle)
```

#### Default Value

The normative default value ($`I^\prime`$) of a list op is a composable
list operation with no elements in its appended, prepended, and deleted
operation sequences.

``` math
I^\prime \equiv (append: \langle \rangle, prepend: \langle \rangle, delete: \langle \rangle)
```

An explicit element sequence containing no elements is still considered
valued and is a distinctly different state from the normative default.
While under iteration, they both yield no elements, they produce
different results when combining.

``` math
I^\prime \neq (explicit: \langle \rangle)
```

All list ops without a valued explicit element sequence are considered
“composable”.

``` math
L \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}} \Leftrightarrow L \notin \mathbb{L_{composable}}
```

#### Iteration

Iteration over a single explicit list operation $`E`$ yields the
explicit element sequence.

``` math
iterate(E) = \langle e_0, e_1, …, e_n \rangle
```

Iteration over a single composable list operation $`C`$ yields all
prepended elements $`\langle p_0, p_1, ..., p_n\rangle`$ not in appended
elements $`\langle a_0, a_1, ..., a_n\rangle`$ followed by all appended
elements.

``` math
iterate(C) = \langle p_0, p_1, …, p_n \mid p_x \notin C_{append} \rangle + \langle a_0, a_1, …, a_n \rangle
```

The deleted element sequence is always ignored for the purpose of
iterating over the elements of a single list operation.

#### Equivalence ($`=`$)

Two list operations are equivalent if their ordered operation sequences
are equivalent. Equivalence is denoted with the $`=`$ symbol.

Two explicit list operations $`E`$ and $`F`$ are equivalent if their
explicit operation sequences $`E_{explicit}`$ and $`F_{explicit}`$ are
equivalent.

``` math
(E, F \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}}) \wedge (E_{explicit} = F_{explicit})\Longrightarrow E = F
```

Two composable list operations ($`C`$ and $`D`$) are equivalent if their
appended ($`C_{append}`$, $`D_{append}`$), prepended ($`C_{prepend}`$,
$`D_{prepend}`$), and deleted ($`C_{delete}`$, $`D_{delete}`$) operation
sequences are equivalent.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
&(C, D        \in \mathbb{L_{composable}}) \wedge\\
&(C_{append}  = D_{append}) \wedge (C_{prepend} = D_{prepend}) \wedge (C_{delete}  = D_{delete}) \Longrightarrow C = D
\end{aligned}
```

Equivalent list operations must be both explicit or both composable.

``` math
A \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}} \wedge  B \in \mathbb{L_{composable}} \Longrightarrow A \neq B
```

#### Combining ($`\sqcup`$)

List operators may be combined into one if they hold elements of the
same type. The combining operation is denoted by the $`\sqcup`$ symbol.

Combining list operations A and B is closed and produces a new list
operation C.

``` math
A \sqcup B → C
```

Combining a stronger explicit list with any weaker list operation
produces a new explicit list operation with the same explicit elements
as the stronger list operation.

``` math
S \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}} \Longrightarrow S \sqcup W → S
```

Combining a stronger composable list operation $`S`$ to an explicit list
op $`E`$ produces a new explicit list operation $`S \sqcup E`$.

``` math
(S \in \mathbb{L_{composable}}) \wedge (E \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}}) \Longrightarrow (S \sqcup E)  \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}}
```

$`S \sqcup E`$ must contain the following ordering of explicit items

- All $`S_{prepend}`$ items not in $`S_{append}`$
- Followed by all $`E_{explicit}`$ items not in $`S_{append}`$,
  $`S_{delete}`$, or $`S_{prepend}`$
- Followed by all $`S_{append}`$ items

As an example, if
$`S = (delete: \langle 5 \rangle, prepend: \langle 5 \rangle, append: \langle 5\rangle)`$,
and $`E = (explicit: \langle 4, 5, 6 \rangle)`$, the result of
$`S \sqcup E`$ should be a new explicit list
$`(explicit= \langle 4, 6, 5 \rangle)`$ because append is the last
operation applied.

Applying a composable list operation $`S`$ to another composable list
operation $`C`$ produces a new composable list operation $`S \sqcup C`$.

``` math
S, C \in \mathbb{L_{composable}} \Longrightarrow (S \sqcup C)  \in \mathbb{L_{composable}}
```

$`S \sqcup C`$ must contain the following orderings of items

- $`(S \sqcup C)`$ has its deleted items ordered by
  - All $`C_{delete}`$ items not in $`S_{prepend}`$ or $`S_{append}`$
  - Followed by $`S_{delete}`$ items not in $`S_{prepend}`$,
    $`S_{append}`$, or $`C_{delete}`$
- $`(S \sqcup C)`$ has prepended items ordered by
  - All $`S_{prepend}`$ items not in $`S_{append}`$
  - Followed by all $`C_{prepend}`$ items not $`S_{append}`$,
    $`S_{delete}`$, or $`S_{prepend}`$
- $`(S \sqcup C)`$ has appended items ordered by
  - All $`C_{append}`$ items not in $`S_{append}`$, $`S_{delete}`$, or
    $`S_{prepend}`$
  - Followed by all $`S_{append}`$ items

#### Congruence ($`\cong`$)

Two list ops $`A`$ and $`B`$ are congruent if they yield the same
iteration order under combination with any other list ops
$`L \in \mathbb{L}`$. Congruence is denoted by the $`\cong`$ symbol.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
A \cong B \equiv &(iterate(A \sqcup C) = iterate(B \sqcup C)) \wedge \\
                 &(iterate(C \sqcup A) = iterate(C \sqcup B)) \forall C \in \mathbb{L}
\end{aligned}
```

Equivalent list operations are inherently congruent.

``` math
A = B \Longrightarrow A \cong B
```

If two list ops are congruent and one is explicit, the other is
necessarily explicit. If two list ops are congruent and one is
composable, the other is necessarily composable.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
(A \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}}) \wedge (A \cong B) \Longrightarrow  (B \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}})\\
(A \in \mathbb{L_{composable}}) \wedge (A \cong B) \Longrightarrow  (B \in \mathbb{L_{composable}})\\
\end{aligned}
```

If two list ops are congruent and one is explicit, they are equal.

``` math
(A \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}}) \wedge (A \cong B) \Longrightarrow  A = B
```

##### Congruent But Not Equivalent List Operations

``` math
\begin{aligned}
C_1 &= &(&append: \langle 10, 50 \rangle, &&prepend: \langle 10 \rangle, &&delete: \langle 50 \rangle&)\\
C_2 &= &(&append: \langle 10, 50 \rangle, &&prepend: \langle 10 \rangle, &&delete: \langle\rangle&)\\
C_3 &= &(&append: \langle 10, 50 \rangle, &&prepend: \langle\rangle, &&delete: \langle\rangle&)\\
C_4 &= &(&append: \langle 10, 50 \rangle, &&prepend: \langle\rangle, &&delete: \langle50\rangle&)\\
C_5 &= &(&append: \langle 10, 50 \rangle, &&prepend: \langle10, 50\rangle, &&delete: \langle50\rangle&)\\
C_6 &= &(&append: \langle 10, 50 \rangle, &&prepend: \langle10, 50\rangle, &&delete: \langle10, 50\rangle&)\\
\end{aligned}
```

``` math
C_1 \cong C_2 \cong C_3 \cong C_4 \cong C_5 \cong C_6
```

The above elements are congruent because they all yield the same
iteration order under combination with all other list ops. Specifically,
authored elements in “prepend” and “deleted” are spurious if they also
appear in “append”. Authored elements in “deleted” are spurious if they
also appear in “prepend”.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
C_m &= &(&append: \langle10, 50\rangle, &&prepend: \langle\rangle, &&delete: \langle\rangle&)\\
C_n &= &(&append: \langle50, 10\rangle, &&prepend: \langle\rangle, &&delete: \langle\rangle&)\\
\end{aligned}
```
``` math
C_m \ncong C_n
```

The above elements are not congruent because their element ordering is
different.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
C_k &= &(&append: \langle10\rangle, &&prepend: \langle50\rangle, &&delete: \langle\rangle&)\\
C_l &= &(&append: \langle50, 10\rangle, &&prepend: \langle\rangle, &&delete: \langle\rangle&)\\
\end{aligned}
```

``` math
C_k \ncong C_l
```

The above elements produce the same iteration order, but are not
congruent because they’ll result in different ordering when combined
with non-empty list ops.

##### Inert List Operations

An inert list op is a list operation which has no effect on traversal of
elements.

Combining list operations with inert list operations may result in
spurious prepended or deleted elements to be removed, yielding congruent
but not always equivalent list operations.

Detecting inertness often requires context about the other operand. The
default list op value was previously introduced as $`I^\prime`$.
$`I^\prime`$ is a trivially inert list operation.

Combining a stronger list operation $`S`$ with the default list
operation $`I^\prime`$ results in a list operation congruent with the
stronger list operation.

``` math
S \sqcup I^\prime \cong S
```

Combining the default list operation $`I^\prime`$ with a weaker list
operation $`W`$ results in a list operation congruent with the weaker
list operation.

``` math
I^\prime \sqcup W \cong W
```

Combining the default list operation $`I^\prime`$ with itself produces
$`I^\prime`$.

``` math
I^\prime \sqcup I^\prime = I^\prime
```

#### Reducing

While individual element sequences must have unique elements, a single
composable list operation may have elements appear in multiple operation
sequences. An individual list operation is in its reduced form if no
elements repeat across sequences.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
reduced(C) \equiv (&append:  &\langle a_0, ..., a_n &\mid a_x \notin \{a_0, ..., a_{x-1}\} \rangle,\\
                   &prepend: &\langle p_0, ..., p_m &\mid p_x \notin \{p_0, ..., p_{x-1}\} \cup \{a_0, ..., a_n\} \rangle\\
                   &delete:  &\langle d_0, ..., d_p &\mid d_x \notin \{d_0, ..., d_{x-1}\} \cup \{a_0, ..., a_n\} \cup \{p_0, ..., p_m\}\rangle)
\end{aligned}
```

To reduce a composable list operation:

- Remove all elements in prepended from deleted\
- Remove all elements in appended from prepended and deleted

Explicit list operations, as they only have one sequence, are inherently
reduced.

Congruent reduced list operations are equivalent.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
A \cong B \Longrightarrow reduced(A) \cong reduced(B)\\
A \cong B \Longrightarrow reduced(A) = reduced(B)
\end{aligned}
```

#### Chaining ($`\bigsqcup`$)

An ordered chain of list operations $`A, B, C`$ may be combined to
produce a new list operation $`D`$.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
A \sqcup B \sqcup C → D\\
\bigsqcup\langle A, B, C\rangle → D
\end{aligned}
```

As the order of application matters, we can say that $`A`$ is stronger
than $`B`$ and $`B`$ is stronger than $`C`$.

Normative traversal of a chain of list ops should yield same ordering of
elements as if the chain was combined to a single list operation.

Combining chains are associative but not commutative with respect to
congruence.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
(A \sqcup B) \sqcup C &\cong A \sqcup (B \sqcup C)\\
B \sqcup A \sqcup C &\ncong A \sqcup B \sqcup C
\end{aligned}
```

Since combining a stronger explicit list operation with any weaker
operation produces a list operation with identical explicit elements,
combining a chain of list operations may terminate after the first
explicit list operation in the sequence is encountered.

``` math
\bigsqcup\langle L_0, …, L_x, …, L_n\rangle = \bigsqcup\langle L_0, …, L_x\rangle \forall L_x \in \mathbb{L_{explicit}}
```

Any inert list operations may be dropped from a chain to produce a
congruent (but not necessarily operation element equivalent) traversal.
Note the default value $`I^\prime`$ is trivially inert and can always be
dropped to produce a congruent traversal.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
\bigsqcup\langle L_0, …, L_n\rangle &\cong \bigsqcup\langle L_0, …, L_n \smallsetminus I^\prime\rangle\\
\bigsqcup\langle A, I^\prime, B, C, I^\prime\rangle &\cong \bigsqcup\langle A, B, C\rangle
\end{aligned}
```

The normative definition of traversal prefers “congruence” over
“equality” so implementers can choose different optimal implementations.
When strict equality is required, note that congruence of reduced list
operations implies equality.

``` math
\begin{aligned}
A, B, C \in \mathbb{L_{reduced}}  &\Longrightarrow \bigsqcup\langle A, I^\prime, B, C, I^\prime\rangle = \bigsqcup\langle A, B, C\rangle
\end{aligned}
```

#### Deprecated Operations

There are two deprecated operations: `reorder` and `add`. These
operations are not normatively specified. Supporting them would prevent
list operations from being closed under combination. They may be
discussed in other specifications for compatibility reasons.

> *Note:* Hand authored example USD layers sometimes use a single
> deprecated `add` operation. This content should migrate to using
> `append`.

# Document Data Model

## Scope

This section specifies the document model of Universal Scene
Description. Documents are resource backed descriptions of scenes termed
a [layer](#glossary).

This section does not provide the specification for any of the required
formats that will implement the layer document model. This does not
generally provide a specification of composition, population, asset
resolution, value resolution, or computation behavior but may note when
fields or types are expected to be inputs to those higher level
functions.

## Layer Structure

Layers specify hierarchical elements of a scene called “specs” (scene
description specifications). Specs contain values stored in named, typed
“metadata fields”. Examples of specs include “prim specs” and “attribute
specs”. Examples of metadata fields include `documentation`,
`references`, or `timeSamples`.

All specs must be addressable by a unique absolute hierarchical
identifier internal to the layer. This identifier is called a “path”.
Paths have a textual representation defined by the [path
grammar](#paths).

Metadata fields are addressable in the context of a spec by a unique
identifier. This identifier is the field’s “name”.

The contents of a layer consist of “values” addressable via a “spec
path” and “field name” pair.

### Example Layer Contents

The following snippet simulates the contents of a layer as a python or
JSON dictionary but should not be taken as a literal implementation.
Performant optimizations should take advantage of path element and field
name redundancy as well as common access patterns and type validation.
This snippet also elides required metadata fields.

``` json
{"/path/to/primSpec": {"someField" : 5, "anotherField" : "value"},
 "/path/to/primSpec.propertySpec" : {"anotherField": "another value"}}
```

## Specs

### Forms

There are six concrete forms of hierarchical specs that may be specified
in a layer:

- [Layer Spec](#layer-specs)
- [Prim Specs](#prim-specs)
- [Attribute Specs](#property-specs-attribute-and-relationship-specs)
- [Relationship Specs](#property-specs-attribute-and-relationship-specs)
- [Variant Set Specs](#variant-and-variant-set-specs)
- [Variant Specs](#variant-and-variant-set-specs)

Attribute specs and relationship specs share several metadata fields and
are collectively termed “property specs”.

### Hierarchy Semantics

Each spec in a layer is identifiable via a unique absolute path. The
hierarchy of specs corresponds to the hierarchy of their paths.

All specs except layer specs have parent specs. All specs except
property specs may have child specs. A parent spec idiomatically
“contains” its child specs but this has no implication on layer storage.

Specs of the same form that share a parent are considered siblings.
Attribute and relationship specs that share a parent may be considered
sibling properties.

The specification promotes the efficient discovery of child specs and
reserves [several metadata fields](#core-metadata-fields) for this
purpose.

### Names

Specs with parents (i.e., all specs except layer specs) have “names”
that uniquely distinguish them from their siblings of the same form.
Attributes and relationship specs with the same parent may not have the
same name. It is otherwise valid for children of different forms to have
the same name and parent.

Spec names are UTF-8 encoded identifiers using the `XID_Start` and
`XID_Continue` classes defined by the Unicode Standard. The following
grammar defines the specific rules for each spec form.

    Dot <- '.'
    Minus <- '-'
    ForwardSlash <- '/'
    Colon <- ':'

``` peg
PrimName <- ([XID_Start] / '_') [XID_Continue]*
```

``` peg
VariantSetName <- ([XID_Start] / '_') [XID_Continue]*
```

``` peg
VariantName <- (Dot ([XID_Continue] / '|' / Minus)*) / ([XID_Continue] / '|' / Minus)+
```

``` peg
PropertyName <- ([XID_Start] / '_') [XID_Continue]* (Colon ([XID_Start] / '_') [XID_Continue]*)*
```

### Layer Specs

Each layer contains one and only one layer spec. The single solidus
character path (`/` or `U+002F`) is reserved to identify the layer spec.
A layer spec has no siblings, no parents, and no name.

A layer spec only contains prim specs as direct children. These are
considered a layer’s root prim specs. The layer spec is the immediate
parent of all root prim specs.

As the ancestor of all root prim specs, the layer spec is sometimes also
known as the “pseudo root spec” but the specification does not
normatively use this term.

### Prim Specs

Prim specs are organizing containers of the other specs in the
hierarchy.

Prim specs may contain variant set specs, property specs, or other prim
specs as direct children. Prim specs must not contain layer or variant
specs.

### Variant and Variant Set Specs

A variant set spec and its child variant specs create branches inside
their parent prim spec with their values being conditionally considered
by higher level composition and population functions.

Variant set specs can only contain variant specs. Variant specs may
contain any spec a prim spec contains including other variant set specs.

### Property Specs (Attribute and Relationship Specs)

Property specs are always leaf elements and must never have child specs.
As leaves, they are the most granular holders of data in a layer.

There are two types of property specs: attribute specs and relationship
specs.

Attribute specs primarily hold fundamental data types and arrays of
those types whose values may vary over time. Relationship specs
primarily store paths. The specifics of how these concepts are
represented can be found in their more detailed definitions below.

## Metadata Fields

A metadata field is defined as follows:

- [Name](#allowed-names)
- [Type](#allowed-types)
- [Supported Spec Forms](#forms)
- [Fallback Value](#fallback-values)
- [Authoring Requirement](#required-fields) (Core Fields Only)
- [Value Ranges](#value-ranges) (Core Fields Only)

Each spec form has a uniform set of allowable metadata fields. Each set
of fields may be extended by implementations but should not vary between
specs of the same form.

Each spec form (i.e., prim spec, relationship spec) may have a different
set of supported metadata fields, but the type of named field must be
globally consistent for all elements utilizing that field. As an
example, not every spec form must support “documentation”, but it must
be “string” for all spec forms that do.

### Allowed Names

Metadata fields are UTF-8 encoded identifiers as defined by the Unicode
Standard \[2\].

The standard provides the definition of the `XID_Start` and
`XID_Continue` class of code points. Field names may start with a
leading `_` (`U+005F`).

``` peg
FieldName <- ([XID_Start] / '_') [XID_Continue]*
```

### Allowed Types

Metadata field storage must support the following types:

- Foundational Data Types
  - Any [Foundational Scalar Type](#scalar-types): `float`, `int`, …,
    `string`, `asset`
  - Any [Foundational Dimensioned Type](#dimensioned-types): `float3`,
    `int3`, …, `matrix4d`, `quath`
  - Any Foundational Scalar Type
    [Array](#arrays-of-foundational-data-types): `float[]`, `int[]`, …,
    `string[]`, `asset[]`
  - Any Foundational Dimensioned Type
    [Array](#arrays-of-foundational-data-types): `float3[]`, `int3[]`,
    …, `matrix4d[]`, `quath[]`
  - [`dictionary`](#dictionaries)
  - [`listop`](#list-operations) of the following types: `int`, `int64`,
    `uint`, `uint64`, `token`, `string`
- [Core Specialized Types](#core-specialized-types)
  - [`ObjectPath`](#speculative-objectpath-as-a-core-specialized-type)
  - [`Spline`](#cubic-splines-specialized-type)
  - [`References`](#references-listopreference-specialized-type)
  - [`Payloads`](#payload-listoppayload-specialized-type)
  - [`Retiming`](#sublayeroffsets-retiming-specialized-type)
  - [`Relocates`](#layerrelocates-relocates-specialized-type)
  - [`VariantValue`](#default-variantvalue-specialized-type)
  - [`TimeSamples`](#timesamples-timesamples-specialized-type)
  - [`EnumVariability`](#variability-enumvariability-specialized-type)
  - [`EnumSpecifier`](#specifier-enumspecifier-specialized-type)

#### No Semantic Aliases

A metadata field must not use semantic aliases. For example, a metadata
field can be a `double3` but not a `color3d`, `point3d`, or `vector3d`.
The layer document model requires that semantic aliases are stored in a
[distinct `typeName` field](#typename-token-1) separately from the
underlying value.

#### Core Specialized Types

Several core fields like `references` hold specialized types. Only the
core fields described by the layer document model may use specialized
types. Implementations may tailor support of core specialized types to
these fields. Extension metadata fields described in other documents
should not use core specialized types.

Specialized fields are used to describe types that have variant,
enumerated option, compound data structure, or map semantics that are
not otherwise handled by the foundational types. Definitions of
specialized types may be found in the [core metadata
fields](#core-metadata-fields) section.

Specialized types should not be supported in
[`dictionary`](#dictionaries) values. Specialized types may adopt list
operation or array semantics (i.e. `listop<SpecializedType>` and
`SpecializedType[]`). If a specialized type uses list operations, it
must provide a well-defined equality operation.

Names used as shorthand to describe core specialized types should not be
read as normative.

#### Speculative `ObjectPath` as a Core Specialized Type

Several core metadata fields (and subfields) hold `ObjectPath` valued
types. `ObjectPath` values speculatively target elements in the
namespace of a layer. A speculative target is a target that might exist,
but there’s no requirement that it is an authored spec. Higher level
composition and population algorithms may impose additional validation
restrictions on speculative targets, but these should not affect how a
layer is read or written.

`ObjectPath` valued fields should only target prim or property specs.
They should not target layer specs, variant set specs, or variant specs.

Every `ObjectPath` value has an injective mapping onto an absolute
textual representation of the path as specified by the [path
grammar](#paths). Note that the full path grammar is not needed for the
purposes of the normative textual representation as `ObjectPath`s should
not target layer, variant, and variant specs.

``` peg
ObjectPath <- (ForwardSlash (PrimName))+ (Dot PropertyName)?
```

`listop<ObjectPath>` valued fields should be considered a specialized
type as well. Path equivalence is defined having equivalent normative
textual representations. Implementations may optimize this and are not
required to store the full textual representation.

#### Cubic Splines Specialized Type

Cubic splines (hereafter referred to as simply “splines”) are data
structures that represent a curved mapping function from time to value.
Each spline is defined by a set of knots; points through which the curve
passes with the shape of the curve controlled by tangents specified at
the knots.

##### `EnumCurveType`

| Value     | Description                           |
|:----------|:--------------------------------------|
| `bezier`  | Defines the spline as a bezier curve  |
| `hermite` | Defines the spline as a hermite curve |

A spline can be either `bezier` or `hermite`.

##### `EnumInterpolationMode`

| Value | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `none` | No interpolation value at this segment |
| `held` | Constant interpolation value at this segment |
| `linear` | Linear interpolation value at this segment |
| `curve` | Bezier or Hermite interpolation value at this segment, depending on spline curve type |

Values along the curve are interpolated according to a chosen
interpolation mode, which may vary along the curve between the knots.
Interpolation can be `held` (constant value along the segment), `linear`
(linearly interpolated value along the segment), `curve` (bezier or
hermite interpolation along the segment), or `none` (implying a value
block where no value exists for the segment).

##### `SplineKnot`

| Subfield              | Type                    | Default |
|:----------------------|:------------------------|:--------|
| time                  | `double`                | 0.0     |
| preTangentSlope       | `double`                | 0.0     |
| preTangentWidth       | `double`                | 0.0     |
| postTangentSlope      | `T`                     | 0.0     |
| postTangentWidth      | `T`                     | 0.0     |
| nextInterpolationMode | `EnumInterpolationMode` | `held`  |
| value                 | `T`                     | 0.0     |
| preValue              | `T`                     | 0.0     |

Each knot is associated with a time, a value at that time, and a pre and
post value defining the slope of the tangent to the curve before and
after the knot. A knot can be dual-valued, meaning there is a value
discontinuity at the knot represented by an additional pre-value. If
`bezier`, knots also store the time width of the pre and post tangent.
The value, pre value, and tangent slopes may be represented by `half`,
`float` or `double` and must be uniform in representation. Each knot
stores an interpolation mode, which defines how the value is
interpolated along the segment following the knot.

Implementations may optionally choose to store a dictionary of custom
data with each knot.

##### `EnumExtrapolationMode`

| Value           | Description                                    |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| `none`          | No extrapolation value in this region          |
| `held`          | Constant extrapolation value in this region    |
| `linear`        | Linear interpolation based on edge knots       |
| `sloped`        | Linear interpolation with specified slope      |
| `looprepeat`    | Knot curve repeated, offset so ends meet       |
| `loopreset`     | Curve repeated exactly, discontinuous join     |
| `looposcillate` | Like `loopreset` but every other copy reversed |

An extrapolation mode defines how to retrieve a value outside the spline
regions (i.e., before all knots and after all knots, referred to as
`pre-extrapolation` and `post-extrapolation`). This mode may be `held`
(constant value), `linear` (linear interpolation based on edge knots),
`sloped` (linear interpolation with a specified slope), `loop repeat`
(knot curve is repeated, offset so the ends meet), `loop reset` (knot
curve is repeated exactly, with discontinuous joins), `loop oscillate`
(knot curve is repeated exactly, with discontinuous joins, but every
other copy reversed), or `none` (implying a value block with no value).

##### `LoopParameters`

| Subfield     | Type     | Default |
|:-------------|:---------|:--------|
| protoStart   | `double` | 0.0     |
| protoEnd     | `double` | 0.0     |
| numPreLoops  | `int`    | 0       |
| numPostLoops | `int`    | 0       |
| valueOffset  | `double` | 0.0     |

A spline may contain a maximum of one inner loop region. This defines
the parameters of an inner loop.

##### `Spline` (Specialized Type)

| Subfield | Type | Default |
|:---|:---|:---|
| curveType | `EnumCurveType` | `bezier` |
| preExtrapolationMode | `EnumExtrapolationMode` | `held` |
| preExtrapolationSlope | `double` | 0.0 |
| postExtrapolationMode | `EnumExtrapolationMode` | `held` |
| postExtrapolationSlope | `double` | 0.0 |
| loopParameters | `LoopParameters` `defaultsOf(LoopParameters)` |  |
| knots | `SplineKnot[]` | \[\] |

Together, the above information defines a spline.

Implementations are free to optimize these data structures as they see
fit.

### Authored State

Metadata fields may be authored or unauthored. An authored metadata
field holds a value that may be accessed by consumers of the layer. An
unauthored field does not hold a value. Metadata fields should hold
values that match the metadata field’s declared type.

#### Required Fields

Specs are puzzle pieces that are intended to fit together to form a
complete view of a scene. Most fields are considered electively authored
in the context of an individual layer. Each spec form has a set of
required fields that must be considered always authored.

A required field for the context of the document should be read as
“required to consume this layer”. Electively specified fields are
elective only for the context of consuming the individual layer. Higher
level constructs may impose additional validation requirements,
including requiring fields to have authored values.

As an implementation detail, any format may choose to elide explicit
storage of any field (including required fields), but it still must
present those fields as being authored if it intends to contribute an
opinion.

### Type Registry

Fields of the same name are required to have the same type.
Implementations generally maintain a registry of field names and types.

Handling a stored value whose type differs from the field’s registered
type is layer format defined. Format implementations may derive an
authored field’s type from the registry when they share an internal
representation, but transparent casting is otherwise discouraged.

For example, `token` and `string` types may share the same storage
representations in both text and binary formats. Numbers may similarly
have a shared storage representation with respect to precision.

### Value Ranges

Implementations of the layer document model should generally not
validate the value of a field beyond meeting the specification of its
type. For example, implementations should not check if an asset path
valued field exists when consuming the layer. Implementations should
check that numeric value is in range when the range is a characteristic
of the type.

Core metadata fields specified in the layer document model may impose
additional per field restrictions on top of the type that
implementations are expected to maintain for the purposes of reading and
writing layers, but no other fields should impose restrictions.

Implementations may consider value restrictions in how they store
fields. For example, a `token` typed field that is constrained to not
have whitespace may elide quotes in its textual representation.

Additional validation restrictions may be imposed by higher level
composition, population, and schema domain functions, but these should
be not reflected in the reading and writing of layers.

### Speculative Values

Many fields can be authored speculatively with semantics requiring a
composed scene graph. It’s generally valid for fields that speculatively
store the names of children or paths that do not exist on the current
layer. Fields that store names, scene paths, and asset paths should be
presumed to be speculative unless otherwise noted.

### Extension Metadata Fields

The layer document model allows the set of metadata fields to be
implementation or schema domain extensible.

- The type of an extension field must never be a [specialized
  type](#core-specialized-types).
- Extension fields must not be [required](#required-fields) to consume a
  layer’s contents.
- Extension fields must not impose additional [restrictions on allowed
  values](#value-ranges) for the purposes of consuming a layer.

User and facility extension fields are generally discouraged in favor of
leveraging existing user data dictionaries or user property namespaces
which are more generally interchangeable.

Authoring and reading of an unknown extension metadata fields is
implementation defined.

### Fallback Values

Each named metadata field should specify its own fallback value that may
be used by consumers when a field is unauthored.

Fallback value acquisition should not be transparent. Consumers must be
able to distinguish between unauthored and authored for any non-required
field.

Required metadata fields by definition cannot be in an unauthored state,
but may specify a fallback to signify a preferred initial value.

Consumers may derive behavior based on authored state before deciding to
acquire a field’s fallback value. Specifying behavior based on the
authored state is necessary for composition and stage population to
function.

Fallback values are specified per metadata field identifier and may not
vary across spec forms.

## Formats

An implementation of the layer document model is called a “format”.
Formats are mappings from storage to a hierarchy of specs and their
metadata fields.

Formats often correspond to specific file formats but are not required
to be file backed. The core specification defines several required and
elective formats for implementations. Implementations may allow
additional formats to be defined as extensions.

Formats must be able to provide:

- A list of a layer’s authored specs
- Values for all required metadata fields if valid
- Authored state for elective fields
- Values for elective fields if authored and valid

While every field has a reserved name that implementations may use for
lookup, implementations may provide for specialized accessors or storage
semantics that can optimize reads. Performant formats should provide for
partial reads of map and dictionary fields (including time samples).

Formats may provide an interface for reading a stored field whose name
is not in a form’s allowed set for the purposes of inspection,
debugging, and repair.

### Format Extensions

Unambiguous and performant format detection should be determined by
extracting an extension from a [resolved asset
location](#resource-interface) for a layer.

Format specifications must declare and reserve one or more extensions
for dispatching layers for read and write. Resource protocol
specifications must specify how to extract an extension from a resolved
asset location.

Format extensions should match the regular expression pattern
`[a-z][a-z0-9]*`. Format extensions `usd[a-z0-9]*` should be considered
reserved for detection and dispatch of formats defined by the core
specification.

Extensions should be case-folded for the purposes of dispatch to a
format’s implementation. For example, assets with extensions `USD`,
`Usd`, and `UsD` should use the `usd` format implementation.

### Format Mapping

A format does not have to support all concepts described in the layer
document model. Supported formats may be classified in terms of
mappability of data between the layer document model and the format.

#### Partially Mapped Formats

Formats whose contents cannot be completely mapped into layer specs and
fields are classified as partially mapped formats. Flattening and other
transformations may not be able to regenerate the original data source.
These are typically read only formats, but the specification doesn’t
forbid implementations from writing to them.

#### Fully Mapped Formats

A fully mapped format’s contents can be completely mapped into layer
specs. The test for a fully mapped format is being able to convert data
to layer document model and back to the original format with equivalent
content.

However, there may be concepts in the layer document model (like variant
specs) that are not representable, so there may be loss when converting
other formats to a fully mapped format.

#### Bijective Formats

A format is considered bijective if

- It can read and write all fields (including extension fields) for all
  spec forms (including variant specs)
- All of its contents can be read and written as fields

Bijective formats are generally designed around the layer document
model.

Authored values must be readable and re-serializable without any loss
when converting between one bijective layer format and another bijective
layer format. For formats which support multiple internal
representations of data (such as multiple compression schemes), the
internal representation is not required to persist across
transformations.

#### Specialization: Forwarding Formats

A format may delegate its implementation to other formats and still meet
the requirements of mapped and bijective formats. A simple forwarding
format delegates its implementation to one or more other formats.
Forwarding formats can be bijective when their delegates are also
bijective.

`usd` is an example of a forwarding format that forwards to either
`usda` or `usdc`.

#### Specialization: Package Formats

An archive may present itself as a single layer. The layer may specify
`asset` valued fields internal to the archive like images, and audio
files. This includes specifying `asset` valued fields holding layers to
be used in composition.

They are called out specially here, as a case of a format that is
otherwise bijective but whose contents may require special consideration
under flattening and other layer transformations.

## Core Metadata Fields

The following are considered core fields \[1\] with their identifiers
reserved for usage across multiple domains including composition and
stage population. Formats may tailor their support for core fields
around allowed value ranges specified for each field but should
otherwise support any valid value for a field’s specified type.

### Layer Spec Fields

#### Hierarchy Fields

These fields list the immediate children of the spec in the layer. These
fields are non-speculative and should present the names of all child
specs.

##### primChildren: `token[]`

Array containing the persistent ordering of names of all root prim
specs.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Format storage should keep this field in agreement with spec storage.
  Handling child prim specs stored but not specified in `primChildren`
  or values in `primChildren` without a corresponding prim spec is
  format defined. This is so formats have the flexibility on how to keep
  them in sync or defer their reading.

#### Composition Fields

The values of these fields are considered inputs to composition.

##### subLayers: `asset[]`

An array of weaker layers for composition to compose via LIVERPS.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Elements of this array should non-empty

##### subLayerOffsets: `Retiming[]` (Specialized Type)

An array of per layer re-timings applied to time samples and any
timecode valued fields.

| Subfield | Type     | Default |
|:---------|:---------|:--------|
| offset   | `double` | 0.0     |
| scale    | `double` | 1.0     |

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- This field should have the same length as subLayers. It’s format
  defined what to do if they do not, allowing formats to read them
  either as independent fields or align their storage.

##### defaultPrim: `token`

The root prim to be used when a layer is targeted by composition arcs
without an explicit prim identifier.

This field is speculative as the target may be introduced through
composition.

A non-empty authored `defaultPrim` should be convertible to an absolute
prim path.

- If `defaultPrim` is a valid prim path as specified by the path
  grammar:
  - If it starts with `/`, it is already an absolute path.
  - Otherwise, it’s a path relative to `/`

Convertibility to an absolute prim path is not a value restriction
applied by the layer document model.

Fallback value: `""`

##### layerRelocates: `Relocates[]` (Specialized Type)

Layer relocates are used by composition to move elements in the scene
graph to other path locations.

| Subfield | Type                  | Default |
|:---------|:----------------------|:--------|
| source   | `ObjectPath`          | N/A     |
| target   | `ObjectPath` or unset | N/A     |

The fields are speculative as the relocate sources may be introduced
through composition.

An empty target subfield implies the source is to be removed from the
scene graph.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- The source path should target a prim path
- The target path, if authored, should target a prim path

#### Population Fields

Fields that affect how specs are populated or traversed.

##### primOrder: `token[]`

Preferred ordering of composed root prims identified by name. A sparse
list implies the explicitly ordered elements should be traversed before
absent ones. This should not affect the ordering of serialized specs.

This field’s primary client is the composed scene graph and may
speculatively include the names of root prims that are not specified in
the reordering layer. The tokens in this field should only contain valid
names for specs.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Elements should be valid prim names.

#### Timing Fields

Fields related to how time samples on this layer should be interpreted.
Some timing fields are advisory and others may affect value resolution.

##### timeCodesPerSecond: `double`

Number of discrete time codes that comprise a second. This may affect
value resolution.

Note that while `timeCodesPerSecond` should be positive, it is not a
formal restriction of the data model.

Fallback value: `24.0`

##### framesPerSecond: `double`

Expected sampling frequency primarily for playback.

Fallback value: `24.0`

Value Ranges:

- Formats should always provide a positive `framesPerSecond` value.

##### startTimeCode: `double`

Start of region of interest of time samples for this layer.

Fallback value: `0.0`

##### endTimeCode: `double`

End of region of interest of time samples for this layer.

Fallback value: `0.0`

#### User Interface Fields

##### documentation: `string`

User facing documentation about a layer that may be displayed in
tooltips and other interfaces.

Fallback value: `""`

#### User Fields

Users may store additional data in these fields.

##### comment: `string`

Container for user notes about a layer.

Fallback value: `""`

##### customLayerData: `dictionary`

Additional user data about the layer. Generally preferable to store user
or site data here than extend the set of metadata.

Fallback value: `{}`

#### Out of Scope Fields

These fields are in reserved for inclusion in future specifications

- expressionVariables
- colorManagementSystem
- colorConfiguration

#### Deprecated Fields

These fields are reserved though their usage is deprecated.

- framePrecision
- hasOwnedSublayers
- owner
- sessionOwner
- startFrame
- endFrame

### Prim Spec

#### Required Fields

These fields must always be specified for all instances of a spec.

##### specifier: `EnumSpecifier` (Specialized Type)

All prim specs must have a specifier field. Higher level composition,
population, and traversal functionality take this into account though it
does not have any semantic meaning at the layer level.

| Value   | Description                 |
|:--------|:----------------------------|
| `def`   | Concrete defining specifier |
| `over`  | Sparse override specifier   |
| `class` | Abstract defining specifier |

While required, these fields have no semantic meaning at the layer
levels. Composition and stage population specifications should describe
how this type composes and impacts traversal of a populated stage.

Fallback value: `over`

#### Hierarchy Fields

These fields list the immediate children of the spec in the layer. These
fields are non-speculative and must present the names of all child
specs.

##### primChildren: `token[]`

Array containing the persistent ordering of names of all child prim
specs.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Format storage should keep this field in agreement with spec storage.
  Handling child prim specs stored but not specified in `primChildren`
  or values in `primChildren` without a corresponding prim spec is
  format defined. This is so formats have the flexibility on how to keep
  them in sync or defer their reading.

##### propertyChildren: `token[]`

Array containing the persistent ordering of names for all child property
specs.

Fallback Value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Format storage should keep this field in agreement with spec storage.
  Handling child property specs stored but not specified in
  `propertyChildren` or values in `propertyChildren` without a
  corresponding property spec is format defined. This is so formats have
  the flexibility on how to keep them in sync or defer their reading.

##### variantSetChildren: `token[]`

Array containing the persistent ordering of names of all child variant
set specs.

Fallback Value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Format storage should keep this field in agreement with spec storage.
  Handling child variant set specs stored but not specified in
  `variantSetChildren` or values in `variantSetChildren` without a
  corresponding variant set spec is format defined. This is so formats
  have the flexibility on how to keep them in sync or defer their
  reading.

#### Composition Fields

These values are considered inputs to composition.

##### references: `listop<Reference>` (Specialized Type)

List operation contributing target inputs to LIVERPS composition.

| Subfield | Type                                            | Default |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------|:--------|
| target   | `asset`, `ObjectPath`, or `(asset, ObjectPath)` | N/A     |
| offset   | `double`                                        | 0.0     |
| scale    | `double`                                        | 1.0     |

A reference can target either an `asset`, an `ObjectPath`, or an
`(asset, ObjectPath)` pair.

Equality of references for the purposes of resolving chains of list
operations requires all fields be equal, including the floating point
offset and scale fields. Approximate equality should not be used on
offset and scale.

Implementations may support a fifth vestigal `dictionary` field for
storing custom data but normatively specified behavior should not depend
on this.

Implementations may share offset/scale data structures with the
`Retiming` data. Targets could be implemented or stored as a variant. It
may also be implemented as two optional subfields but is only valid when
at least one of the subfields is set.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- `ObjectPath` targets should always be prim paths and never property
  paths.

##### payload: `listop<Payload>` (Specialized Type)

List operation contributing target inputs to LIVERPS composition.
Despite the singular field name, the field is a list operation. An empty
asset value implies the path is internal. An empty path implies that the
target is defined by the asset’s metadata. Either asset or path may be
empty but both cannot be.

| Subfield | Type                                            | Default |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------|:--------|
| target   | `asset`, `ObjectPath`, or `(asset, ObjectPath)` | N/A     |
| offset   | `double`                                        | 0.0     |
| scale    | `double`                                        | 1.0     |

A payload can target either an `asset`, an `ObjectPath`, or an
`(asset, ObjectPath)` pair.

Equality of payloads for the purposes of resolving chains of list
operations requires all fields be equal, including the floating point
offset and scale fields. Approximate equality should not be used on
offset and scale.

Implementations may share offset/scale data structures with the
`Retiming` data. The target subfield could be implemented or stored as a
variant. It may also be implemented as two optional subfields but is
only valid when at least one of the subfields is set.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- `ObjectPath` targets should always be prim paths and never property
  paths.

##### inheritPaths: `listop<ObjectPath>`

List operation contributing prim targets that serve as input to LIVERPS
composition.

Paths may be speculative and target prims introduced through
composition.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- `ObjectPath` targets should always be prim paths and never property
  paths.

##### specializes: `listop<ObjectPath>`

List operation contributing prim targets that serve as input to LIVERPS
composition.

Paths may be speculative and target prims introduced through
composition.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- `ObjectPath` targets should always be prim paths and never property
  paths.

##### variantSetNames: `listop<string>`

Names of child variant sets that may contribute to LIVERPS composition.
The order of elements in the list op contributes to the strength order
in LIVERPS.

Variants may be speculative and introduced through composition. Unlike
`variantSetChildren`, this field is not required to be in agreement with
the underlying spec storage.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Elements should be valid variant set names.

##### variantSelection: `VariantSetMap` (Specialized Type)

Variant selection opinions for LIVERPS composition.

- Key Type: `string`
- Value Type: `string`

The key refers to the variant set name and the value refers to the
variant selection of the map.

Selections may be speculative with target variants sets and variants
introduced through composition.

An empty string is valid and implies that no variants should be
considered by composition.

Fallback value: `{}`

Value Ranges:

- Keys should be valid variant set names.
- Values should be variant names or the empty string.

#### Population Fields

##### typeName: `token`

Identifier of a schema. Schemas are used to apply semantic meaning and
allowable behaviors to populated scene elements.

`typeName` only provides an opinion about the schema type to be
considered by composition and has no semantic meaning at the layer
level.

Fallback Value: `""`

Value Ranges:

- This field should be an ASCII identifier as specified by the regular
  expression `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`. Handling invalid type names
  that do not match this pattern is format defined.

##### active: `bool`

If false, this location should be considered removed from the scene
graph allowing some composition and population behaviors to be skipped.

This has no semantic meaning at the layer level, and this field must not
affect a layer’s available specs.

Fallback value: `true`

##### instanceable: `bool`

If true, composition and population behaviors at this location may be
shared and ignore descendant opinions.

This has no semantic meaning at the layer level, and this field must not
affect a layer’s available specs.

Fallback value: `false`

##### kind: `token`

Describes points of interest in the scenes as part of higher level
constructs such as model hierarchy population.

This has no semantic meaning at the layer level.

Fallback value: `""`

##### primOrder: `token[]`

Preferred iteration order of composed child prims identified by name. A
sparse list implies the explicitly ordered elements should be traversed
before absent ones. This should not affect the ordering of serialized
specs.

This field’s primary client is the composed scene graph and may
speculatively include the names of prims that are not specified in the
reordering layer. The tokens in this field should only contain valid
names for specs.

Fallback Value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Elements should be valid prim names.

##### propertyOrder: `token[]`

Preferred iteration order of composed child properties identified by
name. A sparse list implies the explicitly ordered elements should be
traversed before absent ones. This should not affect the ordering of
serialized specs.

This field’s primary client is the composed scene graph and may
speculatively include the names of properties that are not specified in
the reordering layer. The tokens in this field should only contain valid
names for specs.

Fallback Value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Elements should be valid property names.

#### User Interface Fields

Hints as to how specs should present in user interfaces. These
properties should not affect composition, population, or imaging
behaviors.

##### displayName: `string`

Hint as to how the prim may be presented to the user. This is any UTF-8
string and not subject to any of the identifier rules.

Fallback Value: `""`

##### displayGroupOrder: `string[]`

Hint as to how display groups of properties should be ordered.

This field is speculative and may refer to display groups that are
introduced through composition.

Fallback Value: `[]`

##### hidden: `bool`

Hint of whether this prim should be presented to the user in user
interface elements like scene graph tree views.

Fallback value: `false`

##### documentation: `string`

User facing documentation about a prim.

Fallback Value: `""`

#### User Fields

Fields for storing user or site specific data.

##### customData: `dictionary`

Additional user data about the prim. Generally preferable to store user
or site data here than extend the set of metadata.

Fallback Value: `{}`

##### assetInfo: `dictionary`

Additional user data that provides introspection about an asset’s
structure, such as an asset name, identifier, or version number. This
field is advisory and must not participate in composition or asset
resolution.

##### comment: `string`

Container for user notes about a prim.

Fallback Value: `""`

#### Deprecated Fields

These fields are reserved though their usage is deprecated.

- relocates
- symmetryFunction
- symmetryArguments
- symmetricPeer
- suffix
- suffixSubstitutions
- prefix
- prefixSubstitutions
- permission

### Property Spec

#### Required Fields

These fields must always be specified for all instances of a spec.

##### custom: `bool`

Declare whether a property was intended to be schema or user specified.

It is preferred that user defined fields are organized under the
`userProperties` namespace than to rely on the custom field.

Fallback value: `false`

#### User Interface Fields

Hints as to how specs should present in user interfaces.

##### displayName: `string`

Hint as to how the property may be presented to the user. This is a
UTF-8 string and not subject to any of the identifier rules.

Fallback Value: `""`

##### displayGroup: `string`

Hint as to how this property may be organized when presenting to the
user.

Fallback Value: `""`

##### hidden: `bool`

Hint of whether this property should be presented to the user.

Fallback value: `false`

##### documentation: `string`

User facing documentation about how property, often defined in schemas.

Fallback Value: `""`

#### User Fields

Fields for storing user or site specific data.

##### customData: `dictionary`

Additional user data about the property. Generally preferable to store
user or site data here than extend the set of metadata.

Fallback Value: `{}`

##### assetInfo: `dictionary`

Data to provide introspection about asset structure primarily for asset
valued properties. This field is advisory and must not participate in
composition or asset resolution.

Fallback Value: `{}`

##### comment: `string`

Container for users notes about a property

Fallback Value: `""`

#### Deprecated Fields

These fields are reserved though their usage is deprecated.

- symmetryFunction
- symmetryArguments
- symmetricPeer
- suffix
- prefix
- permission

### Attribute Spec

Attribute specs inherit all fields from property spec.

#### Required Fields

These fields must always be specified for all instances of a spec.

##### typeName: `token`

Specifies the expected type of any authored default and time sample
values. This may be a fundamental scalar, dimensioned, or algebraic
type, as well as any associated semantic aliases. Arrays of scalar and
dimensioned types (and their associated semantic aliases) are also
allowed. (ie. `typeName` may be `color3f[]`).

Types that are allowable as metadata fields but not as attribute types
include dictionaries and list ops.

Fallback Value: `""`

Value Ranges:

- This field should be a foundational data type or semantic alias
  identifier constrained by the regular expression
  `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*(\[\])?$`. Handling invalid type names that do
  not match this pattern is format defined.

##### variability: `EnumVariability` (Specialized Type)

| Value | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `varying` | Resolved value of the attribute may but is not required to vary over time |
| `uniform` | Resolved value of the attribute is not expected to vary over time |

This field is speculative and does not imply that `timeSamples`,
`spline`, or `default` have been authored in the current layer (or
ever).

Fallback Value: `varying`

#### Value Fields

These fields are considered the property’s primary value to be resolved.
Note it is not required for `default`, `spline`, or `timeSamples` to be
authored. An attribute may be “specified” but not “valued”.

##### default: `VariantValue` (Specialized Type)

Value that does not vary over time.

A variant value may store a value of one of the following types:

- Any [Foundational Scalar Type](#scalar-types): `float`, `int`, …,
  `string`, `asset`
- Any [Foundational Dimensioned Type](#dimensioned-types): `float3`,
  `int3`, …, `matrix4d`, `quath`
- Any Foundational Scalar Type
  [Array](#arrays-of-foundational-data-types): `float[]`, `int[]`, …,
  `string[]`, `asset[]`
- Any Foundational Dimensioned Type
  [Array](#arrays-of-foundational-data-types): `float3[]`, `int3[]`, …,
  `matrix4d[]`, `quath[]`
- Sentinel “Value Block”

Format implementations should keep the type of `default` in
[agreement](#type-and-alias-agreement) with the `typeName` fields.
Resolving the disagreement is format defined to support formats which
may:

- Infer the `typeName` from the value
- Infer the precision of the value from the `typeName`
- Read the `typeName` without reading the value

Note that the field may store an explicit “Value Block” sentinel to
block weaker opinions in composition without specifying a value. The
sentinel block has a normative textual representation of `None`, but
this is a distinct state. The sentinel value block agrees with any
`typeName`, including `opaque` and `opaque` associated semantic aliases.
The sentinel value block is the only value that agrees with `opaque`
types.

The normative fallback value for `default` is an “empty state” which is
not considered authorable. This is the only type to have an unauthorable
fallback value. Implementations have a lot of flexibility on how to
implement this as it is not stored in any formats. They may choose to
make this empty state a part of their `VariantValue` type, provide an
optional return value, or not surface a fallback value for this field in
their APIs.

Fallback value: Unauthorable Empty Sentinel

##### timeSamples: `TimeSamples` (Specialized Type)

A sequence of values of the same type ordered by discrete time samples.

- Key Type: `double`
- Value Type: A time sample may store a value of one of the following
  types:
  - Any [Foundational Scalar Type](#scalar-types): `float`, `int`, …,
    `string`, `asset`
  - Any [Foundational Dimensioned Type](#dimensioned-types): `float3`,
    `int3`, …, `matrix4d`, `quath`
  - Any Foundational Scalar Type
    [Array](#arrays-of-foundational-data-types): `float[]`, `int[]`, …,
    `string[]`, `asset[]`
  - Any Foundational Dimensioned Type
    [Array](#arrays-of-foundational-data-types): `float3[]`, `int3[]`,
    …, `matrix4d[]`, `quath[]`
  - Sentinel “Value Block”

Format implementations should keep the type of samples in agreement with
the `typeName` fields. Resolving the disagreement is format defined to
support formats which may:

- Infer the `typeName` from the time samples
- Infer the precision of time samples from the `typeName`
- Read the `typeName` or individual time samples without reading the
  whole time sample map

Note that the field may store an explicit “Value Block” sentinel to
block weaker opinions in composition without specifying a value. The
sentinel block has a normative textual representation of `None`. The
sentinel value block agrees with any `typeName`.

Fallback value: `{}`

##### connectionPaths: `listop<ObjectPath>` (Specialized Type)

Stores a path representing a connection to another prim or property.
Interpretation and evaluation of the connection is schema domain
specified and not a part of value resolution. Attributes may have a
value, have a connection, or both.

Targets of `connectionPaths` may be speculative.

Fallback value: `[]`

##### spline: `Spline`

Stores a spline representing a mapping function from time to value. If
an inner loop is defined, negative numbers of `numPreLoops` and
`numPostLoops` have no meaning and shall resolve to `0` if negative.

Discussion of value interpolation with regard to spline data can be
found in the [Value Resolution section](#spline).

Value ranges:

Splines may store values that have the following types:

- `float`
- `double`
- `half`

Format implementations should keep the type of the spline values in
agreement with the `typeName` field of the attribute storing the spline.
Resolving disagreement is format defined to support formats which may:

- Infer the `typeName` from the spline data
- Infer the precision of the spline data from the `typeName`
- Reject data that cannot be coerced to the type defined by `typeName`

Fallback value: `Spline` instance with all default values

##### allowedTokens: `token[]`

For token valued attributes only, this field may be consulted to
populate user interface options or to validate tokens.

This field should not be used for validation at the layer document
level.

Fallback value: `[]`

#### Out of Scope Fields

These fields are reserved for inclusion in future specifications.

- colorSpace

#### Deprecated Fields

These fields are reserved though their usage is deprecated.

- connectionChildren

### Relationship Spec

Relationship specs inherit all fields from property spec.

#### Value Fields

These fields are considered the property’s primary values to be
resolved. It is not required that `targetPaths` be authored. A
relationship may be specified but not valued.

##### targetPaths: `listop<ObjectPath>` (Specialized Type)

Speculative list of targeted paths that be composed into the current
layer stack.

Targets of `targetPaths` may be speculative.

Fallback value: `[]`

#### Deprecated Fields

These fields are reserved though their usage is deprecated.

- relationshipTargetChildren
- noLoadHint

### Variant Set Spec

#### Hierarchy Fields

These fields list the immediate children of the spec in the layer. These
fields are non-speculative and should present the names of all child
specs.

##### variantChildren: `token[]`

Array containing the persistent ordering of names of all child variant
specs.

Fallback value: `[]`

Value Ranges:

- Format storage should keep this field in agreement with spec storage.
  Handling child variant specs stored but not specified in
  `variantChildren` or values in `variantChildren` without a
  corresponding variant spec is format defined. This is so formats have
  the flexibility on how to keep them in sync or defer their reading.

### Variant Specs

All prim spec fields are inherited by variant specs for the strict
purpose of contributing opinions to composed prims. There are no fields
that annotate or describe the variant itself.

# Paths

## Introduction

A *path* represents an addressable location within a context. This
context can be either a single layer, in which case the path refers to a
specific spec within the context of that layer, or a composed stage, in
which case the path refers to a composed scene object.

Examples of paths include \[1\]:

- Those used to represent and address prim specs within a layer or prims
  within a stage.
  - e.g., `/Root/Child/Grandchild`
- Those used to represent and address property specs within a layer or
  properties within a stage.
  - e.g., `/Root/Child/Grandchild.visibility`
- Those used to represent and address prim specs and property specs
  within a particular variant in a layer.
  - e.g., `/Root/Child/Grandchild{size=1}/GreatGrandchild`
  - e.g., `/Parent/Child{color=r}.primvars:color`.

Within this specification, paths can refer to a spec within a layer or
scene object within a stage. Throughout the remainder of this section,
the context should provide the semantics for that path, but for the sake
of brevity, a path referring to a prim spec or prim will simply be
referred to as a *prim path*. Similarly, a path referring to a property
spec or property will simply be referred to as a *property path*.

Paths can be absolute or relative. An absolute path denotes a complete
path from the root of the context (layer or stage) to the object being
addressed. The root of the context is represented as `/`, and is
referred to as the *absolute root path*. Relative paths denote paths
that cannot be fully resolved until rooted elsewhere by anchoring the
relative path to an absolute source. Relative paths can be represented
in several different ways:

- A path starting with a prim name, indicating a child prim of the prim
  the path is rooted at.
  - e.g., `Child/Grandchild` (note that lack of the starting `/` which
    would indicate an absolute path)
- A path starting with a `..`, indicating the parent of the prim the
  path is rooted at.
  - e.g., `../Sibling/Child/Grandchild`
- `.`, otherwise known as the *reflexive relative path* identifies the
  current prim the path is rooted at but may not prefix descendant
  prims.
- A path starting with `.` (but not exactly equal to `.`) indicates a
  property of the prim the path is rooted at.
  - e.g., `.points`

A relative path can only be interpreted once it has been *anchored* to
an absolute path, resulting in the full addressable context of the
object. A relative path *cannot* be made absolute by anchoring it to
another path if by doing so would address ancestors of the absolute root
path. That is, the relative path `../../Descendant` cannot be anchored
to `/Root` because doing so would cause the address to be interpreted on
an ancestor of the absolute root path.

It is illegal for the parent specifier (`..`) to be placed in the middle
of a path; it may only be used as the starting elements of the path.
That is `../Sibling/Child/..` is an illegal path whereas
`../../ParentSibilng/Cousin` is a legal path.

An absolute path to any given prim can be formed by concatenating the
identifiers of its parents together with the `/` character and appending
it to the absolute root path.

Consider the following abstract hierarchy in a composed stage:

    World
      Foo
        Baz
          Foobar
      Bar
        BarBaz

The prim `Foobar` can be addressed by the path `/World/Foo/Baz/Foobar`.
Similarly, the prim `BarBaz` can be addressed by the path
`/World/Bar/BarBaz`. A path anchored at `/World/Baz/BarBaz` to `Foobar`
can be addressed by the path `../../Foo/Baz/Foobar`. Note this process
is the same for addressing prim specs within the context of a layer.

Using the same composed stage, a property of a prim can be addressed by
forming the path to the prim and concatenating that with the identifier
of the property using a `.` character. Adding properties to our abstract
hierarchy:

    World
      Foo
        Baz
          Foobar
            foobarprop1
            foobarprop2
      Bar
        BarBaz
          barbazprop1

The property `foobarprop1` can be addressed by any of the given paths:

- `/World/Foo/Baz/Foobar.foobarprop1`
- `../../Foo/Baz/Foobar.foobarprop1` (anchored at `/World/Bar/BarBaz`)
- `.foobarprop1` (anchored at `/World/Foo/Baz/Foobar`)
- `Baz/Foobar.foobarprop1` (anchored at `/World/Foo`)

Note that a property is a terminal leaf in a path. The same process can
be used to address a property spec within the context of a layer.

Finally, a path can address the content of a specific variant within the
context of a layer. This is done using a variant selector of the form
`{variantSetName=variantName}` rooted at the prim spec the variant set
is contained within. As an example, consider the following layer content
(note this is different from above in that it does not represent a
composed stage)

Let’s make `Foobar` a prim spec of a new variant spec `VarFoobar`:

    World
      Foo
        Baz
          VariantSet1
            VarFoobar
              Foobar
                foobarprop1
                foobarprop2
            VarFoobaz
               Foobaz
      Bar
        BarBaz
          barbazprop1

To then address the property spec `foobarprop1`, the path becomes:

    /World/Foo/Baz{VariantSet1=VarFoobar}Foobar.foobarprop1

To address the prim spec `Foobaz`, the path would select the variant
spec `VarFoobaz`, i.e.,

`/World/Foo/Baz{VariantSet1=VarFoobaz}Foobaz`.

Note that since variant specs may contain variant set specs, there can
be a chain of selected variants specs. For example, consider this layer
hierarchy:

    World
      Foo
        Baz
          VariantSet1
            VarFoobar
              Foobar
                foobarprop1
                foobarprop2
            VarFoobaz
               Foobaz
      Bar
        VariantSet2
          VarBarBaz
            BarBaz
              barbazprop1
          VarBarFoo
            VariantSet3
              VarBarBar
                BarFoo

The prim spec `BarFoo` is addressable by the absolute path:

    /World/Bar{VariantSet2=VarBarFoo}{VariantSet3=VarBarBar}BarFoo

Note that there is no `/` separator between a variant selector and
another variant selector, nor between a variant selector and a prim
spec. A variant selector may also be empty (e.g., of the form `{x=}`).
This indicates that the selection is not the variant spec, but the
variant set spec itself.

One difference to note above is that paths containing variant selectors
are generally used only in the context of a layer. This is because when
a stage is composed, a specific variant has been selected and the paths
to those composed scene objects no longer use the variant selector.
Consider the last example, and that for the composed stage we have
selected `VarFoobar` and `VarBarBaz` as the selected variants. The
composed stage then looks as follows:

    World
      Foo
        Baz
          Foobar
            foobarprop1
            foobarprop2
      Bar
        BarBaz
          barbazprop1

Addressing the prim `Foobar` can be done using the path
`/World/Foo/Baz/Foobar`. This is different from addressing the `Foobar`
primspec in the layer, which was done via the path
`/World/Foo/Baz/{VariantSet1=VarFoobaz}Foobar`.

## Element Ordering

- Normative ordering of elements should be defined as:
  - `'_'` shall be ordered before all ASCII letters and numbers
  - ASCII letters shall be case folded and then ordered according to
    their ASCII values
  - If ASCII letters differ only in case, upper case letters shall be
    ordered before lower case letters
  - ASCII numbers shall be ordered before ASCII letters
  - ASCII numbers shall be ordered as a group, skipping leading `'0'`
    values
  - If a group of ASCII numbers is equal between the two groups and
    differs only in the number of leading `'0'` values, the group with
    the lower number of leading `'0'` values shall be ordered first
  - Unicode characters shall be ordered according to their code points

For example, consider the following property names:

    foobar
    Foobar
    _foobar
    foo_bar
    foo001bar001abc
    foo001bar002abc
    foo0001bar0002xyz
    foo00001bar
    a0
    aü
    ab

The rules above would order these names as:

    _foobar
    a0
    ab
    aü
    foo_bar
    Foobar
    foobar
    foo00001bar
    foo001bar001abc
    foo001bar002abc
    foo0001bar0002xyz

When paths elements of different spec forms are compared, properties
should be ordered before prims which should be ordered before variant
sets. Variants cannot have siblings that aren’t variants.

Sample ordering of children.

    /a.b
    /a/b
    /a{b=}

## Path Grammar

Textual representation of paths use a specific syntax which can be
formally specified as a grammar using PEG \[2\] notation. This grammar
specifies a set of production rules that describe a valid string
representation of a path. Run-time interpretation of that path is based
on the context in which the path is being used. The following formal
specification serves as a reference for implementations to interpret the
semantics behind the textual representation of a path.

> **Note**: Textual representations of a layer enclose paths in an angle
> bracket pair (**\<\>**) but this is not considered part of the path
> grammar.

**The *Path* production rule serves as the entry point for interpreting
a path.**

## Conventions

Whitespace is declared explicitly as part of the production rules. Any
spacing in the production rule that doesn’t refer explicitly to a
whitespace production is spacing to make reading the production rule
easier.

- A short summary of PEG notation used:
  - `<-` represents a production; the specified rule on the left can be
    reduced by matching any rules on the right.
  - `[x]` indicates a character class; valid characters are any that
    fall into the specified class.
  - `'x'` or `"x"` indicates a string, these are literal characters or
    strings present in the production.
  - `/` indicates a choice, and the parser must attempt to match each of
    the production rules in the order they are written until one of them
    succeeds, or they all fail (in which case the production cannot be
    satisfied).
  - `()` is used as a grouping mechanism such that the production rules
    inside are considered one production with respect to the PEG
    operator applied to it.
  - `?` indicates the preceding production rule is an optional rule. The
    parser must interpret this as valid if the production is either not
    present at all or present and valid.
  - `*` indicates the preceding production rule may be present any
    number of times in sequence or may not be present at all.
    Colloquially, this may be thought of as a *zero or more* operator.
  - `+` indicates the preceding production rule must be present at least
    once, but can be present more than once in sequence. Colloquially,
    this may be thought of as a *one or more* operator.
  - `!` indicates a look-ahead sequence that states the production rules
    following that operated on by `!` are only valid if the sequence
    operated on by the `!` is not present.
  - `&` indicates a look-ahead sequence that states the production rules
    following that operated on by `&` should only be evaluated if the
    sequence operated on by the `&` is present.

## Grammar Definition

The textual representation of a path is defined by a simple set of
production rules given below. Paths consist of elements that must be
valid *identifiers*. The rules for identifiers are derived from
identifier recommendations in the Unicode standard \[3\]. In particular,
this grammar uses the `[XID_Start]` and `[XID_Continue]` character
classes to form valid identifiers. This implies that the text
representation of a path must be encoded (e.g., UTF-8) such that they
can be interpreted as Unicode code points (comprising characters that do
not exist in the private-use or non-character code point ranges). Since
Unicode code point values for ASCII characters are equivalent to their
ASCII value, no additional special handling is required.

All identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning that myIdentifier,
MyIdentifier, and myidentifier refer to different identifiers.
Identifier equivalence is code point (or byte) equivalence. The
identifier München may encode ü as a single explicit code point or with
two code points (an umlaut modifier and a u). These are two distinct
identifiers in OpenUSD and runtimes must treat them as such.

> *Note:* The `[XID_Start]` and `[XID_Continue]` character classes are
> referenced here and used in their default form from the Unicode
> database with no further modification. The specific set of code points
> that fall within these character classes can be obtained via the
> DerivedCoreProperties.txt file of the Unicode database \[4\]. The

> time; this specification is based on the character classes as they are
> derived in \[5\].

**Reserved Characters**

As this specification evolves, the Path grammar production rules may be
changed to allow additional characters, particularly for enhancing what
would be considered a valid *Identifier* in the grammar. However, in the
absence of character escaping, there will always be a subset of
characters that the Path grammar considers *reserved characters*, with
the intent that an *Identifier* will likely never be valid if it
contained one of these characters. These characters are defined by the
following rule:

    ReservedCharacters <-  Dot /  
                           ForwardSlash /  
                           LeftCurlyBrace /  
                           RightCurlyBrace /  
                           Colon /  
                           Equals

Note that under the [Compatibility with Legacy
Content](#compatibility-with-legacy-content) section, the set of
restricted characters contains additional characters not restricted by
the normative specification.

## Examples

The following paths are examples of paths that must be parsable by the
grammar and a description of how runtimes should interpret them.

| Valid Path | Description |
|:---|:---|
| / | A single “/” is used by runtimes to address the absolute root of the scene graph, often referred to as the “pseudo-root”. This is one of the few paths supported by the path grammar but isn’t encodable in path valued scene description. |
| . | Given the context of a prim path, a single “.” relatively identifies that prim. |
| .property | Given the context of a prim path, a “.property” relatively identifies a property of that prim. |
| .. | Given the context of a prim, “..” relatively identifies the prim’s parent. |
| ../.. | Given the context of a prim, “../..” relatively identifies the parent of the prim’s parent. |
| ../.points | Given the context of a prim, “../.points” identifiers the `points` property of the prim’s parent |
| Descendant | Given the context of a prim, “Descendant” relatively identifies an direct child prim |
| /City{ selection = NewYork } | While path identifiers must not contain spaces, the grammar supports spaces and tabs in variant expressions. This path is considered to be equivalent to the path with all whitespace removed. “/City{selection=NewYork}” |
| /City/Street{selection=5thAvenue} | While path identifiers must not contain leading digits, variant selections may contain leading digits. |
| /City/Street{selection=} | A variant set without a variant selection identifies the variant set. This path identifies the `selection` variant set spec within the `Street` prim spec. |

The following paths contain examples of paths that must be rejected by
the grammar and an explanation as to why they’re invalid.

| Invalid Path | Description |
|:---|:---|
|  | Empty valued strings may be used in runtimes as sentinel values for an “empty path” or “no path”, but empty strings are not part of the path grammar. |
| ./Descendant/Prim | “.” cannot be followed by “/” to relatively reference descendants. Elide “./” to refer to descendants. |
| /New York/New York | Whitespace is not allowed in path identifiers |
| /abc/123 | Leading digits are not allowed in path identifiers |
| /City/Street{=} | Variant selections may be empty, but variant set names may not be. |
| /abc{123=} | While variant selections may have leading digits, variant set names may not. |
| /Root/ | A trailing slash is not valid |
| /Root//Child | Repeated slashes do not collapse. |
| /Prim/namespace: | The namespace separator must be medial |
| /Prim.:property | The namespace separator must be medial |
| /Prim.namespace::property | Repeated colons do not collapse. |
| /Prim.abc:123 | Leading digits are not allowed in namespaced elements |

## Compatibility with Legacy Content

The grammar defined above represents the normative specification for the
Path grammar. However, as the OpenUSD ecosystem has evolved over the
years, legacy content predating this specification exists. To provide
maximum compatibility with this content, implementations have the option
of supporting additional production rules for the Path grammar. The
semantics of these rules are left unspecified; the additional production
rules represent only a means to successfully parse legacy content for
compatibility. Many of the production rules described in this section
are additional rules but some normative rules are changed to support
compatibility.

    LeftBracket <- '['

    RightBracket <- ']'

``` peg
AsciiIdentifierStart <- [A-Z] /  
                        [a-z] /  
                        Underscore
```

``` peg
AsciiIdentifierContinue <- AsciiIdentifierStart /  
                           [0-9]
```

``` peg
AsciiIdentifier <- AsciiIdentifierStart (AsciiIdentifierContinue)*
```

``` peg
VariantSetName <- IdentifierStart (IdentifierContinue / Hyphen)*  
```

``` peg
MapperArg <- AsciiIdentifier
```

``` peg
MapperPathSeq <- Dot 'mapper' LeftBracket Path RightBracket (Dot MapperArg)?
```

``` peg
RelationalAttributeName <- PropertyName
```

``` peg
RelAttrSeqTail <-  LeftBracket Path RightBracket /  
                   MapperPathSeq /  
                   Dot 'expression'
```

``` peg
RelAttrSeq <- Dot RelationalAttributeName (RelAttrSeqTail)? 
```

``` peg
TargetPathSeq <- LeftBracket Path RightBracket (RelAttrSeq)?
```

``` peg
PropElementsTail <- TargetPathSeq /  
                    MapperPathSeq /  
                    Dot 'expression'
```

``` peg
PropElements <- Dot PropertyName (PropElementsTail)?  
```

Additionally, under the compatibility layer, the set of reserved
characters changes according to the following rule:

    ReservedCharacters <- Dot /  
                          ForwardSlash /  
                          LeftCurlyBrace /  
                          RightCurlyBrace /  
                          Colon /  
                          Equals /  
                          LeftBracket /  
                          RightBracket

## Runtime Considerations

While the Path grammar specifies the syntax for how a path should be
interpreted, and the examples above describe the semantics for how a
path should be interpreted, there are a few additional runtime
considerations worth mentioning:

- **Empty paths**: Empty paths are not valid productions under the Path
  grammar, but oftentimes it is helpful for the runtime to use empty
  strings to represent an “empty path” or “no path”.\
- **Normalization**: Normalization is out of scope for the Path grammar.
  This means that Unicode characters that would normalize to equivalent
  under a particular normalization form (e.g., NKFD, etc.) are treated
  as distinct and hence, the paths containing those characters would be
  treated as distinct paths. For example, the strings “IX” (**U+0049
  U+0058**) and “Ⅸ” (**U+2168**) are distinct strings when normalization
  forms are not applied.\
- **Path Element Length**: There is no restriction on the length of an
  element in the Path grammar. While there may be a practical limit,
  runtime implementations should not assume anything about the maximum
  length of a Path element.

# Resource Interface

## Scope

This section describes Universal Scene Description’s normative
specification for resources or “assets”. Assets are often equivalent to
files but can be generalized to refer to cloud or in-memory resources as
well.

An `asset` value described by the [foundational data
types](#foundational-data-types) is the common storage type for resource
identifiers in scene description.

The principles of the interface are specified here, but not the API.

## Resource Identifiers

Universal Scene Description resources should be locatable using URI
identifiers as specified by RFC 3986 \[1\].

### URI Components

Section 3 of RFC 3986 breaks down a URI into four components:

- scheme
- hierarchy
- query
- fragment

A resource identifier specifies a “scheme” to identify a protocol for
data interaction.

Schemes are case-insensitive and constrained to the grammar specified in
Section 3.1 of RFC 3986.

### Internationalized Resource Identifiers

RFC 3987 \[2\] describes support for Unicode characters in resource
identifiers. Support for internationalized resource identifiers is
delegated to schemes, protocols, and their implementations.

The scheme grammar for RFC 3987 does not deviate from RFC 3986 and is
restricted to ASCII code points only.

### Non-normative Identifiers

Schemes and protocol definition and implementations sometimes support
additional identifier forms that do not strictly adhere to RFC 3986 or
RFC 3987. Implementations should provide deference to schemes and
protocols for what is considered allowable. It’s recommended that
non-normative forms of identifiers be mappable to a normative URI. It’s
recommended that operations on non-normative identifier forms produce
equivalent results to the normative form.

An example of a non-normative identifier would be Windows file system
paths. Windows file system paths can be converted to a normative `file`
URI described by RFC 8089 \[3\]. RFC 8089’s Appendix E and F describes
several nonstandard syntax that implementations of `file` schemes
sometimes support (i.e. `\` as a separator).

## Resource Protocols

Section 1.2.2 of RFC 3986 states that resource identification and
interaction are separate. A resource identifier’s scheme is used to
identify the protocol for interfacing with a resource.

For performance, protocols for a resolved location should support
parallel read access of data. Protocols may support updating or
replacing a resource. Protocols may support a temporary detach to ensure
parallel reads and writes do not conflict.

## Relative Resource Identifiers

RFC 3986 defines syntax for both relative and absolute resource
identifiers. Absolute resource identifiers for the purposes of this
specification are those that have a scheme. Relative identifiers do not.

Relative resource identifiers require a base absolute resource
identifier to be resolved. Section 5.2 of RFC 3986 defines the algorithm
for resolving relative resource identifiers.

### Anchored Relative Identifiers

Section 5.1 of RFC 3986 defines the set of potential sources for a base
URI. Universal Scene Description treats `./` and `../` prefixed
identifiers specially for the purpose of base acquisition when authored
in a Universal Scene Description document. The base URI must be the
authored document. No other bases should be considered.

The `asset` value

    ./goodbye.txt 

authored in

    file:///hello/world.usda 

must resolve to

    file:///hello/goodbye.txt

The `asset` value `goodbye.txt` authored in `file:///hello/world.usda`
is not anchored. Implementations should not treat `goodbye.txt` and
`./goodbye.txt` as equivalent when authored in a document.

### Non-Anchored Relative Identifiers

Applications and implementations may define a set of base URIs for
locating non-anchored relative identifiers. These are commonly
structured as a “search path”. A search path implementation will
commonly attempt to locate a resource at each base path, only reporting
a failure after exhausting the set of paths.

Example search path:

    [
        "file:///lookup-location-1/",
        "file:///lookup-location-2/",
        "https:///remote-lookup-location/",
    ]

Because non-anchored relative identifiers rely on application state,
they are generally non-portable across facilities.

## Resolving Identifiers to Locations

An identifier can be “resolved” to a resource location.

The algorithm for resolving an identifier is defined as:

- Apply relative resolution if necessary (RFC 3986 Section 5.2),
  providing special handling for anchored identifiers if necessary
- Normalize the identifier (RFC 3986 Section 6, RFC 3987 Section 5)
- Dispatch resource location to a protocol specified by the normalized
  identifier

It’s expected that if a resource has been located that it can be opened
and data can be read. It’s acceptable for the resource location to be a
“promise” that it should be available for opening and reading in the
future.

A resource location should be representable as a URI, but it’s not
required to be a persistent value. For example, an application may set
up a temporary directory that stores mirrored assets from higher latency
storage for the lifetime of the process. Applications could even garbage
collect unused assets mid-process.

Resolving an identifier to a resource location may introduce a “change
of scheme”. As an example, consider a strawman contextual scheme
`json-file-lookup`. This scheme could specify that an application
specified json file defines the location of assets. To resolve
`json-file-lookup:AssetA`, a scheme resolver implementation could
perform a lookup in a `json` file which resolves that identifier to a
location on a filesystem `file:///resolved-usd-assets/AssetA.usd`.

## Resolving Extensions

Extension based dispatch is fundamental to Universal Scene Description.
Extension based dispatch allows configuring behavior without opening the
asset.

Unless otherwise specified, an extension should be resolved by the
following algorithm:

- Find the last element of the hierarchy component
- Tokenize it using `.` as the delimiter
- If there are no `.` characters, there is no extension
- Otherwise, the last element is the extension.

As an example, `file:///hello.world/data.v1.txt` should return `txt` as
its extension.

A scheme with custom extension resolving might encode the extension in
its query string. For example, consider the following strawman URI:
`texture-library:paint?extension=exr&color=red`. The specification for
`texture-library` could specify that the value of the `extension`
element of the query determines the extension.

While “changing of scheme” may be common when resolving URI identifiers,
changing of extensions is discouraged. Consider an identifier with a
custom resolver scheme

    decal-library:stickers/rocketship.exr?quality=1k 

It would be confusing to users for that to resolve to
`file:///textures/stickers/rocketship.1k.jpeg`.

## Packaged Resources

Universal Scene Description reserves trailing `[]` to describe a
resource internal to a package. For example,

    file:///asset-cache/AssetA.package[texture.exr] 

may be used to identify a resource inside another resource. A package
format specification is responsible for describing how to locate and
interface with nested resources. Packaged resources may be recursively
defined:

    file:///asset-cache/AssetA.package[textures.zip[paint.exr]]

## Scheme Specifications

The specification does not require Universal Scene Description
implementations to support any URI scheme but at least one must be
supported in order to open a document. It’s recommended that
implementations support the `file` scheme specified in RFC 8089. For
environments that don’t have a file system, it is not required.

We recommend that implementations support the following scheme to
describe in memory resources.

### `usd-anon`

`usd-anon` may be used by implementations to describe in memory
resources whose lifetime is tied to a process.

`usd-anon` resources should never be serialized into scene description.

`usd-anon` should never be used as a base path for anchoring or relative
resolution.

## Additional Notes

Single character URI schemes are not recommended as they can be confused
with drive letters on Windows.

## Security Considerations

Refer to Section 7 of RFC 3986 and Section 8 of RFC 3987 for more
information about security considerations for URI and IRI identifiers
respectively. Scheme specifications like `file` often provide additional
security considerations (RFC 8089, Section 5) as well.

# Composition

## Scope

This section introduces the algorithm for *composition*: the process of
combining opinions for a prim path in multiple layers via a set of
composition operators which themselves are specified in scene
description. The composition algorithm is responsible for evaluating
these operators and providing a “composed” view of a given prim.

## Overview

The composition algorithm takes as input:

- The root layer from which composition should begin
- The path of a prim to compose
- Whether payload composition arcs are considered for this prim

The composition algorithm produces as output:

- A strength-ordered list of layer specs that contribute opinions to the
  prim specified in the input.

Executing the composition algorithm for a given prim is colloquially
referred to as “composing the prim”.

### Outline

    compose_helper(root_layer, prim_path) -> [(LayerStack, PrimOrVariantPath)]:
        queue = []
        if prim_path == "/":
            queue.append((compose_layer_stack(root_layer), prim_path))
        else:
            # Recursively compose "ancestral opinions" from parent prims, then
            # append current prim's name to create initial list of opinions.
            ancestral_opinions = compose_helper(root_layer, prim_path.parent_path)
            for ancestral_layer_stack, ancestral_prim_path in ancestral_opinions:
                queue.append((ancestral_layer_stack, 
                              ancestral_prim_path.append(prim_path.name))

        while !queue.empty():
            layer_stack, prim_path = queue.pop()
            compose_arcs(layer_stack, prim_path, queue)

    compose(root_layer, prim_path) -> [(Layer, PrimOrVariantPath)]:
       layer_stack_opinions = compose_helper(root_layer, prim_path)
       
       opinions = []
       for (layer_stack, path) in layer_stack_opinions:
           for layer in layer_stack:
               if layer.has_spec(path):
                   opinions.append((layer, path))

       return opinions

## Composition Operators

### Sublayers

The sublayer composition arc superimposes scene description from
multiple layers over one another. This composition arc forms an ordered
list of layers called a “layer stack”, where the first layer in the list
is considered the strongest layer and the last layer is considered the
weakest.

Every layer stack begins with a given “root layer”, which is considered
the strongest layer in the layer stack. Each layer in the layer stack
may specify 0 or more additional layers to be added to the layer stack
via the [`subLayers`](#sublayers-asset) field, which provides a
strong-to-weak ordered list of layer asset paths. These additional
layers are considered weaker than the original layer. If the original
layer was itself a sublayer, the additional layers are considered
stronger than all weaker sibling sublayers of the original layer.

If a layer cannot be opened for a sublayer asset path (for example, if
no layer exists at that path or the layer is malformed), it is a
composition error and that sublayer is ignored.

If a specified sublayer would form a cycle when constructing the layer
stack, it is a composition error and that sublayer is ignored.

#### Sublayer Time Offsets

Each sublayer may have an associated “layer offset” that applies a
numerical offset and scale to all time values authored in that layer and
any of its sublayers. By default, the offset is 0 and the scale is 1.0.

Sublayer offsets for a layer’s sublayers are stored in that layer’s
[`subLayerOffsets`](#sublayeroffsets-retiming-specialized-type) field.
The sublayer offset for a given sublayer is the layer offset in the list
stored in the field at the same position that the sublayer’s asset path
is stored in the `subLayers` field.

The effective layer offset for a layer in a layer stack is composed by
taking the effective layer offset of the parent layer that included the
layer in its sublayers and concatenating it with the layer’s sublayer
offset. This is done by applying the `scale` of the parent layer to the
`offset` and `scale` of the child and then adding the `offset` of the
child to the result. Note that composition arcs like references may
apply an additional time offset that concatenates with the layer offsets
in the layer stack.

The composition algorithm is not responsible for applying layer offsets
to time values. This is left to downstream clients, like value
resolution.

If a sublayer offset has a scale less than or equal to 0, it is a
composition error and that sublayer offset is treated as though it had
the default offset and scale values.

#### Examples

*root.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

(
    subLayers = [
        @./sub_1.usda@ (offset = 5; scale = 2.0),
        @./sub_2.usda@
    ]
)

def "Root"
{
}
```

*sub_1.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

(
    subLayers = [
        @./sub_1_1.usda@ (offset = 10; scale = 3.0)
    ]
)

def "Root"
{
}
```

*sub_1_1.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Root"
{
}
```

*sub_2.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Root"
{
}
```

**Opinions for `/Root`**

| Layer        | Spec Path | Effective Layer Offset (offset, scale) |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| root.usda    | /Root     | (0.0, 1.0)                             |
| sub_1.usda   | /Root     | (5.0, 2.0)                             |
| sub_1_1.usda | /Root     | (25.0, 6.0)                            |
| sub_2.usda   | /Root     | (0.0, 1.0)                             |

### Composition Arcs

Composition arcs are operators that specify opinions from a “source”
layer stack and prim that should be included for the prim being
composed.

These arcs are typically authored in scene description in list-op-valued
fields. For example, a prim’s references composition arcs are stored in
the [`references`](#references-listopreference-specialized-type) field.
To compute all the arcs of a given type for a prim in a layer stack, the
corresponding list-op from the weakest layer is applied to an empty
list, then the list-op from the next strongest layer is applied to the
result, and so on until all layers in the layer stack have been
processed This yields a list of 0 or more arcs of the given type where
the first element is the strongest of those arcs and the last element is
the weakest.

#### References

References add the composed opinions of a prim in a layer stack into the
opinions of the referencing prim.

A [‘reference’](#references-listopreference-specialized-type) is an
asset path, prim path, or a tuple of (layer asset path, prim path) where
the layer asset path specifies the root layer of a layer stack and the
prim path specifies the prim from which opinions should be composed. If
no asset path is provided, the reference is considered an “internal”
reference and the layer stack containing the reference is assumed. If no
prim path is specified, the path to the prim specified by the
[`defaultPrim`](#defaultprim-token) field in the specified layer is
assumed.

The list of references for a prim in a layer stack is computed by
applying the list-op computation algorithm above using the `references`
field.

For each reference, the layer stack is computed for the reference’s
layer asset path. The composition algorithm is executed with that layer
stack and the path of the prim indicated by the reference’s prim path to
compute a list of opinions. These opinions are added to the opinions for
the prim currently being composed.

If a layer stack cannot be computed for a reference’s layer asset path,
it is a composition error and that reference is ignored.

If there are no specs in any of the layers of the referenced layer stack
for the reference prim path, it is a composition error and that
reference is ignored.

##### Namespace Mapping

References map the source namespace at and under the referenced prim to
the target namespace where the reference was authored.

For example, given:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "A" (
    references = @./ref.usda@</B>
)
{
}
```

the namespace mapping is **\[(`/A`, `/B`)\]**.

If the reference is an internal reference, the namespace mapping also
includes the identity mapping.

For example, given:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "A" (
    references = </B>
)
{
}
```

the namespace mapping is **\[(`/A`, `/B`), (`/`, `/`)\]**.

##### Reference Time Offsets

Each reference may have an associated “layer offset” similar to a
sublayer offset. This offset applies to all layers in the referenced
layer stack.

If a reference offset has a scale less than or equal to 0, it is a
composition error and that offset is treated as though it had the
default offset and scale values.

##### Examples

*root.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "LocalRef"
{
}

def "Root" (
    references = [
        </LocalRef>,
        @./ref_1.usda@</Ref_1>,
        @./ref_2.usda@
    ]
)
{
}
```

*ref_1.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Ref_1" (
    references = @./ref_1_1.usda@</Ref_1_1>
)
{
}
```

*ref_1_1.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Ref_1_1"
{
}
```

*ref_2.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
    defaultPrim = "Ref_2"
)

def "Ref_2"
{
}
```

**Opinions for `/Root`**

| Layer        | Spec Path |
|--------------|-----------|
| root.usda    | /Root     |
| root.usda    | /LocalRef |
| ref_1.usda   | /Ref_1    |
| ref_1_1.usda | /Ref_1_1  |
| ref_2.usda   | /Ref_2    |

#### Payloads

Payloads are references that may either be composed (“loaded”) or
ignored depending on the payload flag passed as input to the composition
algorithm.

If the payload flag indicates that payloads should not be loaded, all
payload composition arcs encountered during composition are ignored.

If the payload flag indicates that payloads should be loaded, all
payload composition arcs are processed on the prim being composed and
all ancestor prims that are composed during that process.

Otherwise, composing payloads is exactly the same as references, except
that the list of payloads on a prim are computed using the
[`payload`](#payload-listoppayload-specialized-type) field.

##### Namespace Mapping

Namespace mappings for loaded payloads are the same as for references.

##### Payload Time Offsets

Time offsets for loaded payloads behave the same as offsets on
references. Time offsets for unloaded payloads are ignored.

##### Examples

*root.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "LocalPayload"
{
}

def "Root" (
    payload = [
        </LocalPayload>,
        @./payload_1.usda@</Payload_1>,
        @./payload_2.usda@
    ]
)
{
}
```

*payload_1.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Payload_1" (
    payload = @./payload_1_1.usda@</Payload_1_1>
)
{
}
```

*payload_1_1.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Payload_1_1"
{
}
```

*payload_2.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
    defaultPrim = "Payload_2"
)

def "Payload_2"
{
}
```

**Opinions for `/Root` (payload excluded)**

| Layer     | Spec Path |
|-----------|-----------|
| root.usda | /Root     |

**Opinions for `/Root` (payload included)**

| Layer            | Spec Path     |
|------------------|---------------|
| root.usda        | /Root         |
| root.usda        | /LocalPayload |
| payload_1.usda   | /Payload_1    |
| payload_1_1.usda | /Payload_1_1  |
| payload_2.usda   | /Payload_2    |

#### Inherits

The inherits composition arc adds composed opinions from a specified
prim in the layer stack where the arc is introduced, as well as all
layer stacks that were responsible for introducing that layer stack via
other composition arcs.

The list of inherits for a prim in a layer stack is computed by applying
the list-op computation algorithm above using the
[`inheritPaths`](#inheritpaths-listopobjectpath) field.

For each inherit prim path, the composition algorithm is executed with
the path and the layer stack containing the inherits. Those opinions are
added to the opinions for the prim currently being composed.

Each inherit arc “implies” the presence of an inherit arc in all
upstream layer stacks that introduced the original layer stack
containing the authored inherit arc, up to and including the root layer
stack. These “implied” inherit arcs behave as though an inherit arc was
authored in these layer stacks on the prims that introduced those layer
stacks. The prim path for the implied inherit arc is computed by
applying namespace mappings from the original inherit prim path.
Opinions from implied inherit arcs are computed like any other inherit
arc and added to the opinions for the prim currently being composed.

If none of the layers in the layer stack where the inherits arc was
authored contain specs for the inherit prim path, it is a composition
error. It is *not* a composition error if there are no specs for any or
all of the associated implied inherit arcs.

##### Namespace Mapping

Inherit arcs map the source namespace at and under the inherited prim to
the target namespace where the inherit was authored, and all other paths
to themselves.

For example, given:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "A" (
    inherits = </B>
)
{
}
```

the namespace mapping is **\[(`/A`, `/B`), (`/`, `/`)\]**.

##### Examples

*root.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Root" (
    references = @./ref.usda@</Ref>
)
{
}
```

*ref.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

class "Inherit_1" (
    inherits = </Inherit_2>
{
}

class "Inherit_2"
{
}

def "Ref" (
    inherits = </Inherit_1>
)
{
}
```

**Opinions for `/Root`**

| Layer     | Spec Path  |
|-----------|------------|
| root.usda | /Root      |
| root.usda | /Inherit_1 |
| root.usda | /Inherit_2 |
| ref.usda  | /Ref       |
| ref.usda  | /Inherit_1 |
| ref.usda  | /Inherit_2 |

#### Specializes

The specializes composition arc is similar to the inherits composition
arc, but opinions added by this arc have a special strength ordering
applied to them. See the [Strength Ordering](#strength-ordering) section
for more details.

Composing opinions for specializes is exactly the same as inherits,
except that the list of specializes are computed using the
[`specializes`](#specializes-listopobjectpath) field.

##### Namespace Mapping

Namespace mappings for specializes are the same as for inherits.

##### Examples

*root.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Root" (
    references = @./ref.usda@</Ref>
)
{
}
```

*ref.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

class "Specialize_1" (
    specializes = </Specialize_2>
{
}

class "Specialize_2"
{
}

def "Ref" (
    specializes = </Specialize_1>
)
{
}
```

**Opinions for `/Root`**

| Layer     | Spec Path     |
|-----------|---------------|
| root.usda | /Root         |
| ref.usda  | /Ref          |
| root.usda | /Specialize_1 |
| ref.usda  | /Specialize_1 |
| root.usda | /Specialize_2 |
| ref.usda  | /Specialize_2 |

#### Variants

The variants composition arc allows users to select which *variant* of
scene description contained within a *variant set* should contribute
opinions to a given prim.

The list of variant sets for a prim in a layer stack are computed by
applying the list-op computation algorithm above using the
[`variantSetNames`](#variantsetnames-listopstring) field.

For each variant set, a corresponding variant selection must be computed
to determine which of the variants in the set (if any) will be composed.
If the computation returns no variant selection, the variant set is
ignored. Otherwise, the composition algorithm is executed with the
current layer stack and the prim variant selection path that addresses
the selected variant in the variant set on the prim. Those opinions are
added to the opinions for the prim currently being composed.

Evaluating variants must be deferred until all other composition arcs
have been evaluated, so that all sources of opinions are available for
computing the variant selection.

##### Computing Variant Selection

The variant selection is computed by examining the list of opinions for
the current prim in strong-to-weak order and finding the strongest
opinion for the
[`variantSelection`](#variantselection-variantsetmap-specialized-type)
field whose dictionary value contains an entry whose key is the name of
the variant set. The entry’s value is the name of the variant selection.

If a variant selection was previously decided for a variant set in a
layer stack, that selection must be used when composing the same variant
set in other layer stacks.

##### Namespace Mapping

Variants do not remap namespace as they conceptually represent a
“branch” of scene description in the same namespace as the containing
prim. Thus, the namespace mapping for variants is the identity mapping
**\[`/`, `/`\]**.

##### Examples

*root.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Root" (
    references = @./ref.usda@</Ref>
    variants = {
        string v = "x"
    }
)
{
}
```

*ref.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Ref" (
    variantSets = ["v"]
    variants = {
        string v = "y"
    }
)
{
    variantSet "v" = {
        "x" {
            def "X"
            {
            }
        },
        "y" {
            def "Y"
            {
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Opinions for `/Root`**

| Layer     | Spec Path |
|-----------|-----------|
| root.usda | /Root     |
| ref.usda  | /Ref      |
| ref.usda  | /Ref{v=x} |

#### Relocates

Relocates map opinions from the source layer stack (i.e. a layer stack
included via another composition arc) to a new path in the current layer
stack.

The relocates for a prim in a layer stack are computed by examining the
[`layerRelocates`](#layerrelocates-relocates-specialized-type) field of
each layer and finding the entry whose target path entry matches the
prim’s path. If such an entry is found, the composition algorithm is
executed with the layer stack and the entry’s source path to compute the
opinions from the relocation source. Those opinions are added to the
opinions for the prim currently being composed. All previously-computed
ancestral opinions except those due to ancestral variant arcs are
removed from the prim’s list of opinions.

A relocated prim will still receive the same opinions from inherit arcs
it would have had it not been relocated.

If any opinions are authored in a layer stack at a source path of a
relocates statement in that layer stack, it is a composition error and
those opinions are ignored.

If an entry in the `layerRelocates` field violates any of the following
restrictions, it is a composition error and that entry is ignored.

- A relocate cannot apply to the pseudo-root or root prim paths.
- Relocate source and target paths must be prim paths.
- A relocate may not place a prim at the place of an existing ancestor.
  e.g. `/Prim/Child/GrandChild` to `/Prim/Child` is not supported.
- A relocate may not place a target path below a source path.
  e.g. `/Prim/Child` cannot be moved to `/Prim/Child/GrandChild`.
- Each source path may only have one possible target, and each target
  may only have one possible source path.
- A target path must not be the same as a source path.
- If a relocate has “ancestral relocates” (e.g. an ancestor prim that
  has also been relocated), the relocate source path must use the
  ancestral relocated path. For example, if you have `/Root` referencing
  `/Ref`, and `/Ref` also references `/Ref2`, if `/Root/Ref` is
  relocated to `/Root/RefRelocated`, any additional relocate that would
  use `/Root/Ref/Ref2` as a source path must use the relocated path
  `/Root/RefRelocated/Ref2`.

##### Namespace Mapping

Composition arcs authored in layer stacks with relocates have an
additional namespace mapping composed on top of their own namespace
mappings. This additional mapping is computed by taking all relocates
entries whose source path are prefixed by the path of the prim where the
composition arc is authored, then adding entries to the mapping that map
the source namespace at or under the relocates source path to the
corresponding relocates target path.

For example, given:

*root.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
    relocates = {
        </A/B> : </A/C>,
        </Other/B> : </Other/C>
    }
)

def "A" (
    references = @./ref.usda@</Ref>
)
{
}
```

*ref.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Ref"
{
    def "B"
    {
    }
}
```

the additional relocates namespace mapping for `/A` is **\[(`/A/B`,
`/A/C`)\]**. When composing the reference arc authored on `/A`, this
mapping composes with the standard reference namespace mapping
**\[(`/Ref`, `/A`)\]** to produce the final namespace mapping for the
reference arc **\[(`/Ref`, `/A`), (`/Ref/B,`/A/C\`)\]**.

##### Examples

*root.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
    relocates = {
        </Root/Child> : </Root/Relocated_Child>
    }
)

def "Root" (
    references = @./ref.usda@</Ref>
)
{
    over "Relocated_Child"
    {
    }
}
```

*ref.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Ref"
{
    def "Child"
    {
    }
}
```

**Opinions for `/Root/Relocated_Child`**

| Layer     | Spec Path             |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| root.usda | /Root/Relocated_Child |
| ref.usda  | /Ref/Child            |

## Strength Ordering

The strength order of two opinions X and Y for a given prim is computed
by examining the layer stack/stacks that contain those opinions as well
as the chain of layer stacks and composition arcs that introduced those
layer stacks.

If X and Y have the same spec path but come from different layers in the
same layer stack, then the stronger opinion is the one that comes from
the stronger layer in the layer stack. [see example
1](#example-1-sublayer-strength-ordering)

Otherwise, the strength ordering is computed by examining the layer
stacks and composition arcs that introduced the opinions.

If X was authored in a layer stack and Y was authored in some other
layer stack that was introduced via a composition arc authored in X’s
layer stack, then X is stronger than Y. Said another way, “local”
opinions from a layer stack are stronger than all “remote” opinions that
are introduced via composition arcs authored in that layer stack.

If X and Y were introduced by two different types of composition arcs
authored in the same layer stack, the stronger opinion is the one
introduced by the stronger composition arc type, which follow this
order:

- Inherits
- Variants
- Relocates
- References
- Payloads
- Specializes (\* see Specializes section below)

[see example 2](#example-2-composition-arc-ordering)

This strength ordering of local and remote opinions is commonly referred
to using the **LIVERPS** (pronounced “liver-peas”) mnemonic:

**L**ocal, **I**nherits, **V**ariants, R**e**locates, **R**eferences,
**P**ayloads, **S**pecializes

If X and Y were introduced by the same type of composition arc authored
in the same layer stack, their strength order is based on the following
criteria:

- If X was introduced by a composition arc authored “deeper” in
  namespace than Y, then X is stronger, and vice versa. [see example
  3](#example-3-namespace-depth-strength-ordering)

- Otherwise, if X was introduced via an authored composition arc and Y
  was introduced via an implied composition arc, then X is stronger, and
  vice versa. [see example 4](#example-4-implied-vs-authored-ordering)

- Otherwise, X is stronger if the composition arc that introduced it was
  stronger than Y’s composition arc in the order computed when composing
  the list of composition arcs in that layer stack. [see example
  5](#example-5-sibling-arc-ordering)

### Specializes

Opinions introduced by specializes arcs follow a different strength
ordering behavior. Specializes are ordered as the weakest of the
composition arcs, but opinions introduced by specializes arcs are
*globally* weaker than other opinions. Said another way, if prim A
specializes prim B, then all opinions for prim A must be stronger than
all opinions for prim B. This includes all implied opinions related to
prim B and opinions from composition arcs that are introduced by prim B.
[see example 6](#example-6-specializes-strength-ordering)

### Examples

#### Example 1 (sublayer strength ordering)

*root.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
    subLayers = [
        @./sub_1.usda@,
        @./sub_2.usda@
    ]
)

def "Root"
{
}
```

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Root"
{
}
```

*sub_2.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "Root"
{
}
```

**Opinions for `/Root`**

| Layer      | Spec Path |
|------------|-----------|
| root.usda  | /Root     |
| sub_1.usda | /Root     |
| sub_2.usda | /Root     |

}

def "Root" (
    references = @./ref.usda@</Ref>

    }
)

)
{
    def "Child" (

def "Ref1"
{
}

def "Ref2"
{
}

def "Root" (
    references = [
        </Ref1>,

def "Root" (
    references = @./ref.usda@</Ref>
)
{
}
```

*ref.usda*

``` python
#usda 1.0

class "Class_1" (
    specializes = </Class_2>
{
}

class "Class_2"
{
}

def "Ref" (
    specializes = </Class_1>
)
{

```

**Opinions for `/Root`**

| Layer     | Spec Path |

| root.usda | /Class_1  |
| ref.usda  | /Class_1  |
| root.usda | /Class_2  |
| ref.usda  | /Class_2  |

For comparison, if the specializes arcs were all switched to inherits,
the opinions would be:

## Namespace Mappings

Each composition arc has an associated “namespace mapping” that
describes how to transform prim paths between a “source” namespace
(where opinions are authored) and a “target” namespace (where the
composition arc that composes in those opinions was authored). For
example, if a prim `/A` has a reference arc to prim `/B`, then `/B` is
the source namespace and `/A` is the target namespace.

Namespace mappings are bijections; as such they can be inverted, and
multiple mappings can be composed together to create a single namespace
mapping that maps the source namespace of the first mapping to the
target namespace of the last.

Conceptually, a namespace mapping may be represented as a collection of
(source path, target path) pairs. Each pair indicates that any paths in
the source namespace at or under the source path can be transformed to
the target namespace by replacing the source path prefix with the target
path. The source and target path must both be prim paths, or both be the
root path `/`. The latter case represents an identity mapping that maps
a given path to itself.

If a path in the source namespace is not prefixed by any source paths in
the namespace mapping, it cannot be transformed to the target namespace.
This indicates that the object addressed by the path in the source
namespace does not address an object in the target namespace.

### Examples

*With namespace mapping \[(`/A`, `/B`)\]*:

| Source Path | Target Path |
|-------------|-------------|
| /A          | /B          |
| /A/Child    | /B/Child    |
| /C          | <invalid>   |

*With namespace mapping \[(`/A`, `/B`), (`/`, `/`)\]*:

| Source Path | Target Path |
|-------------|-------------|
| /A          | /B          |
| /A/Child    | /B/Child    |
| /C          | /C          |

## Composition Errors

A “composition error” is an error in the specification of a composition
operator in scene description. The composition algorithm does not
terminate if it encounters a composition error when composing a prim;
all other composition operators for that prim are evaluated and the
computed opinions are returned as normal.

# Stage Population

## Scope

This section specifies the process of *stage population*, the process of
forming a *stage* consisting of composed *prims* with the ability to
fully resolve values taking into account all opinions in all layer specs
contributing to the stage.

This section does not provide any specification for implementing this
process; it is up to the reader to decide how best to do so for their
unique requirements (e.g., fully populate and resolve, lazy populate,
etc.).

## The Stage

A *stage* represents a composed view of a scene graph from a layer root
path down to each child path present in the composed layer. Each
interior or leaf node in the scene graph represents a *prim*; the
composed form of all prim specs providing opinions for the prim at a
given path. A stage is defined by a *root layer*, which defines the
layer spec providing the root of the scene graph. *Population* of a
stage is the process of traversing each prim path reachable starting at
the root of that layer, composing the opinions of each prim spec for
that path, determining whether the composed prim should be active in the
scene graph, and performing scene graph instancing to determine the
final scene graph for the stage.

The content of each of the prims in the stage (e.g., attributes,
metadata, variants, etc.) also require composition, and the process at
which the final value of a metadata field is obtained is known as *value
resolution*. In most cases, the final value of a metadata field is the
strongest opinion of the composed opinions on that value contributing to
the spec. In other cases, an additional value resolution process is
performed on that composed data to return a final value. For example,
some foundational data types support interpolation to produce values not
explicitly specified in scene description.

## Populating the Stage

Populating a stage starts with choosing a layer to serve as the root
layer. Additionally, a *population mask* may be provided which may
contain a set of absolute paths denoting exactly which objects to load
into the scene graph. If provided, only the prims at those paths will be
populated onto the stage. Ancestors of those paths *must* be populated
to the stage as well. If no paths are provided, all objects reachable
from the absolute root path will be populated. The population mask may
also provide a flag indicating whether to load payload arcs, which can
be passed as input to composition of [payloads](#payloads).

**Inputs**: Root Layer, Optional Population Mask

**Outputs**: Composed Stage

    populate_stage(root_layer, population_mask) -> stage:
      queue = []
      
      # create a scene object to represent the root path
      layer = create_scene_object('/')
      queue.enqueue(layer)

      while !queue.empty():
        scene_object = queue.dequeue()

        # determine whether the scene object is active
        # if not, no need to consider it or any descendants
        if is_absolute_root_path(scene_object.path) or scene_object.value_resolve('active'):

            # compose the object
            scene_object.opinions = compose(root_layer, scene_object.path)

            # the scene object is active, determine if it's
            # instanceable - we only need to compose instanceables
            # once and then we can reuse that representation
            if !is_absolute_root_path(scene_object.path) and
                scene_object.value.resolve('instanceable') and
                has_composition_arc(scene_object):
                
                # the scene object is instanceable
                # if we already have a shared representation for it
                # we don't need to do anything, if we don't
                # we need to create the shared representation
                # and we need to populate the children the first time
                # which are then shared across all instances
                if not has_shared_representation(scene_object):
                    create_shared_representation(scene_object)
                    scene_object.children = populate_children(scene_object, population_mask, true)
                else:
                    # we can skip everything else because we already processed the children
                    # of the instance the first time
                    continue
            else:
                scene_object.children = populate_children(scene_object, population_mask, false)

            # create scene objects for all children
            # then add those to the queue to compose
            for child in scene_object.children:
              queue.enqueue(child)

        return create_stage(layer)

    populate_children(scene_object, population_mask, is_instanceable) -> child_scene_objects:
       # for each element in prim children, create a scene object
       # to represent the child, relocating if necessary
       # and ensuring it is filtered in the population mask
       child_scene_objects = []
       
       # if it's instanceable, we need to filter out local opinions here
       children = list_ordered_prim_children(scene_object)
       if is_instanceable:
        children = filter_out_local_opinions(scene_object, children)

       for child_name in children:
            child_path = scene_object.path.add_prim_path(child_name)

            # is it filtered by the population mask?
            # that is, does the population mask have content and
            # is this path either in the population mask or represents
            # an ancestor of a path in the population mask
            if population_mask and not population_mask.is_path_or_ancestor(child_path):
                continue

            # create a scene object for the child
            scene_object = create_scene_object(child_path)
            child_scene_objects.append(scene_object)

        return child_scene_objects

Each population step requires visiting a path to:

- Create a scene object for that path
- Perform composition on that scene object
- Retrieve the children of that scene object
- Recursively visiting the child paths

These steps build the scene object hierarchy for the stage. Note that
descendants are not considered for prims that are *inactive* (e.g., the
[resolved value](#value-resolution) of the [`active`](#active-bool)
metadata field is `false`). Local opinions on descendants are also not
considered for *instanced* prims (e.g., the [resolved
value](#value-resolution) of the [`instanceable`](#instanceable-bool)
metadata field is `true`) *and* the prim is composed of at least one
composition arc (i.e., has at least one value in one or more of the
[`references`](#references-listopreference-specialized-type),
[`variantSets`](#variantselection-variantsetmap-specialized-type),
[`payload`](#payload-listoppayload-specialized-type),
[`inheritPaths`](#inheritpaths-listopobjectpath), or
[`specializes`](#specializes-listopobjectpath) metadata fields).

### Ordered Prim Children

The normative ordering of prim children requires merging
[`primChildren`](#primchildren-token) from each contributing spec,
resorting by [`primOrder`](#primorder-token) after every merge. Specs
are iterated on in reverse order. Relocates are applied once per layer
stack, applying to all weaker layer stacks. Relocates that are “rename”
operations within the same primitive must preserve the original order of
the source primitive. Relocates that are “extend” operations which add
additional children must [sort these relocated
children](#element-ordering) before merging. Relocates that “remove” or
“rename” a child must prevent stronger layer stacks from introducing
children with that name.

    reorder(names, order) -> reordered:
        unordered_names = [n for n in names if n not in order]
        ordered_names = [o for o in order if o in names]
        return ordered_names + unordered_names

    list_ordered_prim_children(scene_object) -> ordered_prim_children:
        prim_children = []
        # relocated_names are forbidden from being reused once relocated
        relocated_names = set()

        for layer_stack in reversed(scene_object.strength_ordered_layer_stacks):
            # Retrieve the relocates that affect the children of the scene object
            # removed_children and extended_children are token sets.
            # renamed_children is a token to token dictionary where the key is the source
            # (original name) and the value is the target (new name)
            removed_children, extended_children, renamed_children =
                layer_stack.relocated_children(scene_object)
            # remove children that have been relocated
            prim_children = [child for child in prim_children if child not in removed_children]
            # replace children that have been renamed due to a relocate
            prim_children = [child if child not in renamed_children else renamed_children[child]
                for child in prim_children]
            # append path element sorted children
            prim_children += path_element_sorted(extended_children)
            relocated_names = relocated_names.union(removed_children).union(renamed_children.keys())
            for spec in reversed(layer_stack.strength_ordered_specs):
                # When uniquifying a sequence, the first occurence of a repeated element
                # must be preserved and all other occurences deleted.
                prim_children = reorder(unique(prim_children + spec.prim_children),
                                        unique(spec.prim_order))
        return [child_name for child_name in prim_children if child_name not in relocated_names]

Each of these names are appended to the path of the parenting scene
object as described [here](#introduction) to form the path of each child
to create a scene object for.

### Ordered Property Children

The normative ordering of property children requires merging
[`propertyChildren`](#propertychildren-token) from each contributing
spec with the composed [prim definition
properties](#the-prim-definition), sorted by [path element
ordering](#element-ordering) and applying the strongest
[`propertyOrder`](#propertyorder-token) to the sorted children.

    list_ordered_property_children(scene_object) -> ordered_property_children:
        property_children = set(scene_object.prim_definition.properties)
        for spec in scene_object.specs:
            property_children = property_children.union(spec.property_children)
        # See 'Ordered Prim Children' for reorder
        return reorder(path_element_sorted(property_children),
                       scene_object.strongest_authored_property_order)

> *Note*: Unlike `primOrder`, only the strongest authored
> `propertyOrder` opinion affects the normative property order

### Scene Graph Instancing

If the strongest opinion of the `instanceable` metadata field is `true`,
the resulting prim is an instance prim so long as it has at least one
composition arc. This has direct implication on the structure of the
scene graph in that:

- An optimization should be made such that all instances of the same
  prim are composed only once. Overrides may not be specified on an
  instance prim.
- Local opinions are discarded, which also includes local opinions
  contributing to `primChildren`. This ensures that only the opinions
  brought in by the composition arc are used to determine the set of
  children, which are then shared across all instances of the same prim.

It is up to the implementation how to model the shared representation of
instanced prims sharing the same arc.

## Scene Graph Model Hierarchy

The model hierarchy is a contiguous subset of the prim hierarchy
specified through the value of the [`kind`](#kind-token) metadata field
of a prim. A prim can have one of the following well-defined `kind`
values:

- `group`
- `assembly`
- `component`
- `subcomponent`

If the value of `kind` for a prim is `component`, the value of `kind`
for the parent prim should be `assembly` or `group`. Similarly, if the
value of `kind` for a prim is `assembly` or `group`, the value of `kind`
for the parent prim should be `assembly` or `group` to produce a
contiguous model hierarchy. Based on this, the traversal of the model
hierarchy includes `component` but not descendants of the `component`.

For the purposes of model hierarchy traversal and continuity, `assembly`
and `group` are equivalent. `assembly` implies a user defined point of
interest while `group` does not. A fourth `kind`, `subcomponent`, is not
considered part of the model hierarchy. It uses the `kind` field to tag
important points of interest outside of the model hierarchy.

It is implementation dependent whether to validate model hierarchy
rules. Other values of `kind` (including the empty string) are not
included in the model hierarchy and should terminate continuity and
traversal.

Implementations may provide customizable aliases for `assembly`,
`group`, `component`, or `subcomponent`, but these shall not be
considered generally portable.

## Stage Queries

Prims can be queried via a set of predicate flags offering the ability
to validate the usage of a prim as part of the scene traversal. As an
example the application can query whether a prim is loaded or part of
the model hierarchy. The following represents the list of flags that
should be queryable on a `Prim`.

- Active - The resolved value of the `active` metadata field for the
  prim and all ancestors is `true`
- Loaded - Is the prim currently loaded or unloaded.
- Model Hierarchy - Is the prim part of the contiguous model hierarchy
  (i.e., the resolved value of `kind` is `component`, `assembly`, or
  `group` and all ancestor `kind` resolved values are `assembly` or
  `group`).
- Abstract - The resolved value of `specifier` for the prim and *any*
  ancestor is `class`
- Defined - The resolved value of `specifier` for the prim and *all*
  ancestors is [defining](#specifier) (`class` or `def`)
- Instance - Is the prim marked as instanceable. See the discussion on
  [instancing](#scene-graph-instancing).

As an informative note, the query “active, loaded, defined and not
abstract” generally provides the region of interest used in imaging and
simulation. The term “concretely defined” may be used to mean “defined
and not abstract”.

Stage traversal or queries should follow the preferred prim ordering as
defined by the [path element order](#element-ordering).

# Value Resolution

## Scope

*Value resolution* is the process of resolving the value of a metadata
field either at a specified time or when no time is specified. In most
cases, the value of the metadata field is the value provided by the
composed strongest opinion on the value of the field. However, there are
a few cases that require additional computation. Although the process is
similar for both attributes and metadata, there are subtle differences
to how the values are resolved, in particular, metadata does not support
time varying evaluations. This section discusses value resolution for
metadata, attribute, and relationship values as well as the
interpolation methods used where necessary to resolve those values.

## Metadata Resolution

Metadata field value resolution is the simplest form of value resolution
in that it is not time varying and retrieves the strongest opinion of a
value determined by composition. That said, there are a few special
cases that require a different process for value resolution.

### specifier

Authored `specifier` values are considered *defining* (`class`, `def`)
or *undefining* (`over`). Value resolution has special rules that take
into the authored value of `specifier` on all composed specs.

- *Undefining* (`over`): All contributing opinions for the `specifier`
  field are `over`
- *Abstractly Defining* (`class`): The strongest *defining* opinion for
  `specifier` not from a direct inherit is `class` OR all of the prim’s
  defining specifiers are `class`
- *Concretely Defining* (`def`): The strongest *defining* opinion for
  `specifier` is `def` OR the strongest *defining* opinion for
  `specifier` not from a direct inherit is `def`

While not a part of value resolution, the resolved value of ancestor’s
`specifier` field contribute to a prim’s overall state. A composed prim
is *defined* if a prim and all ancestor prims have a *defining*
specifier (`class` or `def`). A composed prim is *concretely defined* if
all ancestors are *concretely defining* (`def`).

More information on specifiers can be found in the [document data
model](#specifier-enumspecifier-specialized-type).

### typeName

In the case of both attributes and prims, the value of the `typeName`
metadata field is determined by examining the [prim
definition](#the-prim-definition) and not the strongest opinion in the
composed stack. Note this is different from other fields, that will
examine the strongest opinion in the composed stack before consulting
the prim definition.

### variability

The attribute `variability` metadata field resolves similar to
`typeName` in that the field is determined by examining the prim
definition. If there is no value in the prim definition, value
resolution will return the *weakest* opinion in the composition stack.

### custom

The attribute `custom` metadata field has special value resolution that
will examine all entries in the composition stack and return `true` if
*any* of the opinions in the stack was authored to `true`. Note that if
a property is a schema defined property, by definition it cannot be
custom.

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries have special combining rules detailed
[here](#dictionaries). Composition provides a strength ordering of
dictionary value opinions and value resolution takes these opinions and
combines them according to those combining rule, resulting in the value
returned by value resolution.

The example below illustrates combining opinions on the `customData`
dictionary.

``` python
def sphere "CueBall"(
    customData = {
        bool a = true
    }
)
{}

over "CueBall" (
    customData = {
        bool b = false
    }
)
{
    double radius = 2.0
}
```

will result in value retrieved for `customData` being resolved as

``` python
customData = { 
    bool a = true
    bool b = false
}
```

### List Op Resolution

Value resolution for a generic metadata field of type `listop`
[combines](#combining-) the entire stack of values for the field on a
composed object. Implementations of value resolution must produce a
value [congruent](#congruence-) (but not equivalent) to the combined
stack of opinions. Implementations may prune combination at the first
explicit list operation or drop inert values in the stack as noted in
the [specification for list operations](#list-operations) to produce
congruent resolved list operation values.

> *Note:* List op valued fields like `references`, `payload`,
> `inheritPaths`, `specializes` are inputs to composition and do not
> participate in standard metadata value resolution.

> *Note:* Attribute connections and relationship targets value
> resolution follow the rules of generic metadata field list operation
> value resolution.

### Layer Metadata

Layer metadata resolve values (including dictionaries) authored on the
root layer spec and does not consider values authored on sublayers or
other composition arcs. That is, these values do not participate in
composition and no strength ordered opinion list is required to resolve.

### Fallback

If no value is authored for a metadata field, value resolution should
return the fallback value detailed for each field in the [data
model](#fallback-values).

## Attribute Resolution

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/value_resolution_chart.svg"
alt="Attribute Value Resolution" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Attribute Value Resolution</figcaption>
</figure>

Attribute values require more complex value resolution. As an
attribute’s value comes from the composition of layers that may contain
opinions and authored values it is important that the correct value is
queried from the appropriate layer. An attribute spec can hold three
different metadata fields defining a value:

- [`default`](#default-variantvalue-specialized-type)
- [`timeSamples`](#timesamples-timesamples-specialized-type)
- [`spline`](#spline-specialized-type)

Furthermore, a prim containing an attribute can hold the following
metadata fields that may affect that attribute’s value:

- [`clips`](#extension-metadata-fields)
- [’clipSets\`](#extension-metadata-fields)

Value clips allow time samples to be split into multiple layers; this is
useful when dealing with heavy animated geometries like crowds or
simulations and for scientific visualizations.

An attribute value can also be blocked. When a spec is marked as blocked
in the opinion stack, weaker values need not be considered (and if the
strongest opinion is blocked, the fallback value should be returned).

The layer stack is iterated from the strongest layer looking in the
specs for authored values for the named attribute, either at a specified
time or at the default time. The process will stop the iteration once an
appropriate authored value is found, which will be the authored value on
the strongest available layer. If at the end of the iteration no
authored value is found, the fallback value will be provided.

An attribute can have multiple datums authored on any given layer. In
such a case the process first verifies if time is to be considered. If
it is not then the default (non-time varying) value is evaluated by
considering the strongest opinion of the `default` metadata field. If
time based evaluation is considered then the strongest opinion of the
following metadata fields are consulted (in the order given):

- `timeSamples`
- `spline`
- `default`
- `clips`

This happens on each spec contributing to composition. If no data is
authored across the specs, then evaluation proceeds to the fallback
value.

If a value at the default time is queried, the evaluation consults the
`default` metadata field. If this field is unauthored, evaluation
proceeds to the fallback value.

An example of a pseudo implementation for value resolution of time
samples using the resulting composition is given below. In this case
`Held` and `Linear` interpolation are supported. “Default” time is
signified when time is defined as a “NaN” in the implementation and
`spec` is the attribute spec to query.

Interpolation of time samples.
In this example, timeSamples is a list of (time, value) pair 
sorted by time:

ex: [(0, Float:6), (1, Float:8), (10, Float:-1)]

This example is using linear search for demonstration purpose,

```

The authored time codes can be accessed from a spec with the following

``` python
if (time_samples := spec.fields.get("timeSamples")) is not None:
    timeCodes = time_samples.value
```

### Default Values

The default value (“Has Default Time Data” in the diagram) is a specific
datum on the specs that stores a value with **no specific time**.

To resolve this value, the specs for that attribute in each composed
layer are queried for an authored default value. It will start at the
strongest layer based on composition and iterate through the layers
until an authored value is found. If no authored default value is found
then what is known as the `fallback value` is returned. The fallback
value for metadata fields defined in the [core
schema](#document-data-model) are given in their respective sections.

If a value is queried at a specific time and no time samples have been
authored, the query will ignore time and provide either the authored
default value if found or a fallback value.

#### Authored Default Values

``` python
#usda 1.0

def Sphere "CueBall"  
{  
    double radius = 5  
}
```

Extending the sample code, the default can be accessed with the
following

``` python
def _process_default(self, spec: Spec):
    if (def_value := spec.fields.get("default")):
        return def_value.value
    return None
```

### Time Based

When an attribute value is queried at a specific time, the query will
take into account

1.  Time Samples (from the `timeSamples` metadata field)
2.  Spline Evaluation (from the `spline` metadata field)
3.  Value clips (from the `clips` metadata field of the parent of the
    attribute)

The query will iterate all layers that have authored values on them
starting at the strongest layer looking at each spec with the
appropriate name for a time sample. Time Samples have higher priority
over *Spline evaluation* or *Value clips*.

#### Layer Offset and Scale

References and sublayers can provide values to allow offsets in
animation through the
[Retiming](#sublayeroffsets-retiming-specialized-type) specialized type.
The time sample at a `timeCode` to be used will be computed from the
optional `offset` and `scale` values provided when loading the
composition.

``` python
#usda 1.0  
(  
    subLayers = [  
        @./cueball.usda@ (offset = 10; scale = 0.5)
    ]  
)
```

In this example if the current `timeCode` is 12 the time sample will be
calculated `((12 * 0.5) + 10) = 16`, 16 being the new `timeCode` for
sampling the animation in the sublayer.

It is important to note that `scale` **must be a positive none zero
value**. Negative scale is particularly problematic as it results in
time reversal and this causes problem when determining interpolation
types for spline segments. For example, [inner loop
interpolation](#inner-loops) **requires** a start knot to be authored so
reversing the spline will cause issues in evaluation of the inner loop.

Held interpolation is also affected by the reversal of time.
[Held](#held) interpolation uses the local time and does not take into
account that the time samples have been reversed resulting in unexpected
evaluations.

#### Time Samples

The following text example shows the radius of the sphere with time
samples at (1, 5, 10) with associated values (0, 3.14, 6.28).

``` python
#usda 1.0

def Sphere “CueBall”
{  
    double radius.timeSamples = {
        1:0,
        5:3.14, 
        10:6.28,
    } 
}
```

Example code to access the timeSamples

``` python
def _process_time_samples (self, spec: Spec, time: float):
    if timeSamples := spec.fields.get("timeSamples"):
        timeCode = timeSamples.value
        # sort based on time
        timeCode.sort(key=lambda tc: tc[self.TIME])
        return self._interpolate(timeCode, time)
    
    return None
```

`timeCode` will be in the form of a (time, value) pair in this case
resulting in `[(1, Float:0), (5, Float:3.14), (10, Float: 6.28)]`

When the query finds a time sample on a layer for the attribute,
interpolation is used to evaluate the correct value across the range of
time samples at the time specified. For the specified time the
intersection point is found between the two time codes and
interpolation, either **Held** or **Linear** will be performed. Please
see the [interpolation](#interpolation) section for more details.

### Spline Evaluation

Using the active time, if the time falls inside the range of the
authored definition the spline is evaluated using its basic form. If the
time lies outside this range the evaluation needs to consider
extrapolating loops or if authored inner loops to calculate the
resulting value. More information can be found in [Interpolation:
Extrapolating Loops](#extrapolating-loops) and [Interpolation: Inner
loops](#inner-loops)

### Value Clips

Value clips allow the partitioning of time samples into multiple layers.
Metadata defines how the frames map to the clip layers. Value clips
specified within clip files are not subject to composition, i.e., all
data must be recorded directly, not inside `variants` or across
`references` arcs. That is, while the `clips` and `clipSets` metadata
fields compose as normal, the values inside the individual clip files do
not compose.

#### Clip Sets

A “clip set” is a named group of value clips. The set of value clips
along with sequencing and timing information and other value resolution
behaviors are specified in the `clipSets` metadata field. The clip set
definitions are stored in a dictionary-valued metadata field named
`clips`. This allows users to define clip sets in various layers and
have them compose together, or sparsely override metadata in clip sets
non-destructively.

Clip sets may be defined using one of two possible forms of metadata.

- Explicit
- Template

Explicit metadata encodes the exact assets and sequence timings.
Template metadata, on the other hand, authors a regex-style asset path
template, and derives the explicit metadata when a stage is opened.

Template metadata is strictly less powerful than explicit metadata. It
can’t achieve behaviors such as looping, reversing, or holding clip
data, but it can provide a more compact and easy way to debug encoding
for situations in which animation is broken up into a large number of
regularly named files.

When both explicit and template clip metadata is authored, explicit will
be chosen.

##### Common

Metadata common to both explicit and template formats.

###### primPath

A prim path that will be substituted for the stage prim’s path when
querying data in the clips. For instance, if clip metadata is authored
on prim `/Prim_1`, and primPath is `/Prim` the attribute `/Prim_1.size`
would resolve to `/Prim.size`. This is the path that will be used to
look for values in each clip.

###### manifestPath

An asset representing the path to a layer that contains an index of the
attributes with time samples authored in the set of clips.

###### interpolateMissingClipsValue

A boolean flag indicating whether values for clips that do not have
authored time samples for attributes in the manifest should be
interpolated from surrounding clips. See [Interpolating missing value
clips](#interpolating-missing-values-in-clip-set) for more information.

##### Explicit

Explicit metadata encodes exact assets and sequence timings.

###### assetPaths

An ordered list of asset paths to the clips holding time varying data.

###### active

A list of pairs of the form (stageTime, assetIndex) representing when a
particular clip in assetPaths is active and should be considered during
value resolution. See [Active time](#active-clips) for more details

###### times

A list of pairs of the form (stageTime, clipTime) representing the
mapping from stage time to clip time, for whichever clip is active at
the given stage time. See [Stage Times and Clip
Times](#stage-time-and-clip-time) for more details.

###### Explicit Metadata

Here is an example of an animated quad with a timeSample per frame using
Explicit clips:

First the stage.usda containing the clips metadata for authored `Plane`:

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
    startTimeCode = 0
    endTimeCode = 2
)

def Xform "Geo" (
    clips = {
        dictionary default = {
            double2[] active = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
            asset[] assetPaths = [@./quad_1.usda@, @./quad_2.usda@, @./quad_3.usda@]
            asset manifestAssetPath = @./manifest.usda@
            string primPath = "/Geo"
            double2[] times = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        }
    }
)
{
    def Mesh "Plane"
    {
        float3[] extent = [(-1, -1, -0.1), (1, 1, 0.1)]
        int[] faceVertexCounts = [4]
        int[] faceVertexIndices = [0, 1, 3, 2]
        point3f[] points
    }
}
```

Clips are defined as metadata in the `Geo` transform. The clip files
quad.1.usda, quad.2.usda, quad.3.usda have authored time samples 1,2 and
3 which get assigned to the stage timecodes 0,1,2 respectively. In this
example we can also see that the `Plane` mesh doesn’t have points.
Points are defined in the clip layers quad.1.usda, quad.2.usda,
quad.3.usda.

quad_1.usda

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
    defaultPrim = "Geo"
    metersPerUnit = 1
)

def Xform "Geo"
{
    def Mesh "Plane"
    {
        float3[] extent = [(-1, -1, -0.1), (1, 1, 0.1)]
        int[] faceVertexCounts = [4]
        int[] faceVertexIndices = [0, 1, 3, 2]
        point3f[] points.timeSamples = {
            1: [(-1, -1, 0), (1, -1, 0), (-1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0)],
        }
    }
}
```

quad_2.usda

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
    defaultPrim = "Geo"
    metersPerUnit = 1
    upAxis = "Z"
)

def Xform "Geo"
{
    def Mesh "Plane"
    {
        float3[] extent = [(-1, -1, -0.1), (1, 1, 0.1)]
        int[] faceVertexCounts = [4]
        int[] faceVertexIndices = [0, 1, 3, 2]
        point3f[] points.timeSamples = {
            2: [(-1.2, -1.2, 0), (1, -1.2, -0.2), (-1, 1.2, 0), (1, 1, 0)],
        }
    }
}
```

quad_3_usda

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
    defaultPrim = "Geo"
    metersPerUnit = 1
    upAxis = "Z"
)

def Xform "Geo"
{
    def Mesh "Plane"
    {
        float3[] extent = [(-1, -1, -0.1), (1, 1, 0.1)]
        int[] faceVertexCounts = [4]
        int[] faceVertexIndices = [0, 1, 3, 2]
        point3f[] points.timeSamples = {
            3: [(-1.3, -1.3, 0), (1.3, -1, -0.4), (-1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0)],
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, the clip manifest specifies that the `points` attribute of the
clips should be used.

manifest.usda

``` python
#usda 1.0

over "Geo"
{
    over "Plane"
    {

        point3f[] points

    }
}
```

##### Template Metadata

Template metadata based on a regex style authoring for asset paths.

###### templateAssetPath

A regex style template string representing the form of asset path names.
This can be of two forms:

- path/clipname.###.usd
- path/clipname.###.###.usd

These represent integer stage times and sub-integer stage times
respectively. In both cases the number of placeholders in each section
is variable, and indicates how much padding to apply when looking for
asset paths. Note that the format of this string is important. There
must be exactly one or two groups of placeholders, and if there are two,
they must be adjacent, separated by a dot.

###### templateStartTime

The double precision float first number to substitute into our template
asset path. For example, given `path/clipname.###.usd` as a template
string, and 12 as a template start time, the resulting asset path will
have `path/clipname.012.usd` as its first element. If the template asset
path represents integer frames and the start time has a fractional
component, it will be truncated to an integer.

###### templateEndTime

The double precision float last number to substitute into our template
string. If the template asset path represents integer frames and the end
time has a fractional component, this component will be truncated to an
integer.

###### templateStride

A double precision float number indicating the stride to be used for an
increment when looking for files to resolve. For example, given a start
time of 12, an end time of 25, a template string of
`path/clipname.#.usd`, and a stride of 6, paths will be resolved as
follows: `path/clipname.12.usd`, `path/clipname.18.usd` and
`path/clipname.24.usd`.

###### templateActiveOffset

An optional double precision float number indicating the offset to be
used when calculating the clip Active value. Given a start time of 101,
an endTime of 103, a stride of 1, and an offset of 0.5, the following
will be generated:

``` python
times = [(100.5,100.5), (101,101), (102,102), (103,103), (103.5,103.5)]
active = [(101.5, 0), (102.5, 1), (103.5, 2)]
```

Two additional clip time ‘knots’ must be generated on the ends of the
clip Time array. This allows users to query time samples outside the
start/end range based on the absolute value of their offset. In this
case 100.5 and 103.5 are added.

Note that `templateActiveOffset` cannot exceed the absolute value of
`templateStride`.

##### Template Metadata Example

Example of using a templated metadata extended from the example given
for explicit.

``` python
def Xform "Geo" (
    clips = {
        dictionary default = {
            string templateAssetPath = [@./quad_###.usda@]
            double templateStartTime = 0
            double templateEndTime = 2
            double templateStride = 1
            asset manifestAssetPath = @./manifest.usda@
            string primPath = "/Geo"
        }
    }
)
```

In this example the clip files will be resolved to quad_001.usda,
quad_002.usda and quad_003.usda based in the `templateStartTime` and
`templateEndTime`. Once the files have been resolved the `times` and
`active` metadata can be derived. For each time `t` specified in each
derived `assetPath`, the `times` (t, t) will be authored; similarly, the
`active` (t, n) will be authored, where n represents the index of the
derived assetPath. If `templateActiveOffset` is specified, it will be
applied to the derived times and active metadata.

#### Manifest

The manifest describes which attributes the value clip layers will
provide. The manifest file allows value resolution to determine which
attributes have clips available without having to query each clip file.
In this case it defines that the `points` attributes of `Plane` will
have values defined by a clip.

manifest.usda:

``` python
#usda 1.0

over "Geo"
{
    over "Plane"
    {
        point3f[] points
    }
}
```

#### Active Clips

The entries in the `active` metadata determines when a particular clip
is active. Value resolution will retrieve values from the active clip
for that given time.

A `[stageTime, assetIndex]` entry indicates that the clip in the
`assetPaths` metadata at position assetIndex is active from time
stageTime up to the stageTime of the next entry in the list. The first
clip in the active metadata is also considered active for all *earlier*
times, and the last clip is considered active for all *later* times.

As an example

``` python
    double2[] active = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
    asset[] assetPaths = [@./quad_1.usda@, @./quad_2.usda@, @./quad_3.usda@]
```

quad_1.usda, being the first clip to be loaded, will be active from time
-inf to 1. Quad_2.usda is active from time 1 to 2 and quad3.usda, being
the last clip, will be active from time 2 to +inf.

#### Stage time and Clip time

Conceptually, the (stageTime, clipTime) entries in the times metadata
define a timing curve that specifies the time in the active clip to
retrieve samples from when requesting an attribute’s value at a given
stage time. This timing curve is made up of linear segments whose
endpoints are specified by the entries in times, sorted by stageTime.

For example, given this `times` metadata from the previous example:

``` python
double2[] times = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
```

When an attribute value at time 0 is requested, value resolution will
retrieve the time sample value authored at time 1 in the active clip,
and at time 1 it will ask for the value authored at time 2 and so forth.
These entries are the endpoints for a linear segment in the timing
curve, so times between these entries will be linearly interpolated.

For example, requesting an attribute value at time 1.5 will cause value
resolution to ask for the value authored at time 2.5 in the active clip.

The `times` metadata can be used to offset and scale animation from
clips, providing flexibility in how they are applied to the stage.

#### Value Resolution of Clip Values

A clip set may provide values for attributes on the prim on which the
clip set is defined and any attributes on descendants of that prim. It
is important to note that value clips do not define attributes on a
stage, they just provide values. If a clip set has values for an
attribute but that attribute is not defined on the stage (for example,
the attribute is not a built-in attribute of a schema), the clip set
will not cause the attribute to come into existence.

The strength of data in a set of value clips is based on the anchor
point. The anchor point is where the `assetPaths` or `templateAssetPath`
is defined. The anchor point determines the strength of the value clip.
The clip data is just weaker than the `Local` (L in [LIVERPS](#liverps))
data of the anchoring layer. Clip data can be overridden by adding
overrides to a stronger layer or in a local opinion, just as for any
other kind of data.

During attribute value resolution, if clip sets are defined on the
attribute’s owning prim or its ancestors, value resolution will perform
the following:

- Determine the path that will be consulted within clip layers when
  looking for values. The path will be constructed using the attribute’s
  path within the local LayerStack, with a prefix substitution based on
  the clip’s `primPath` metadata. Composition arcs are ignored within
  clip files, i.e., all data must be recorded directly, not inside
  variants or across reference arcs.

- Find the strongest clip set that has the attribute at the above path
  declared in the manifest. This involves looking at the clip sets
  authored on the attribute’s owning prim as well as that prim’s
  ancestors.

- If no clip set is found, the process will iterate to the next spec
  layer.

- Query the clip set for the attribute value at the specified time. This
  “external” time will be mapped to the “internal” time of the clip set
  using the `times` metadata. The active clip will be opened and queried
  using this time.

- If an authored time sample at this time is found in the active clip,
  that is the final value. If there is no sample at that time, but there
  are other samples in the active time range of the clip, the final
  value will be interpolated from those samples. If values are missing,
  then the options defined in the manifest will define whether a
  fallback, sentinel, or interpolated value is returned.

To further detail the strength ordering of a Value clip consider the
following example. In this example the manifest simply defines that the
clip provides values for attributes “local” and “ref”.

root.usda

``` python
def "Model_1" (
    clips = {
        dictionary default = {
            asset[] assetPaths = [@./clip.usda@]
            asset manifestAssetPath = @./manifest.usda@
            string primPath = "/Model"
            double2[] active = [(10.0, 0)]
        }
    }

    references = @./ref.usda@</Model>
{
    float local = 1.0
    float local.timeSamples = {
        5: 5.0,
        10: 10.0,

    }
}
```

ref.usda

``` python
def "Model" (
)
{
    float ref = 1.0
    float ref.timeSamples = {
        5: 5.0,
        10: 10.0,
   }
}
```

clip.usda

``` python
def "Model"
{
    float local = -100.0
    float local.timeSamples = {
        5: -5.0,
        10: -10.0
    }

    float ref = -100.0
    float ref.timeSamples = {
        5: -5.0,
        10: -10.0
    }
}
```

In this example the anchor is at the local layer. `assetPath` is defined
in Model’s metadata. As mentioned, Value clips are slightly less strong
than the local layer, meaning that requesting a value on attribute
*local* at `timecode` 10 will result in a value of 10. In this case the
value clip is ignored as values have been authored on a stronger layer,
that is the local layer. However, if a value for *ref* was to be
requested at time 10, the value returned will be -10. The value of “ref”
from the clip data is resolved as it is stronger than the referenced
layer.

To highlight the strength order further, the following example shows how
both ancestor and descendants have to be visited in order to select the
correct clip to use for value resolution. The “root.usda” contains a
basic hierarchy based on a `reference` with an `over` on subgroup that
authors a new clip for its attributes.

            string primPath = "/ModelGroup"
            double2[] active = [(0.0, 0)]
        }
    }
)
{
    over "Subgroup"
    {

                    asset[] assetPaths = [@./clip-model.usda@]
                    string primPath = "/Model"
                    double2[] active = [(0.0, 0)]
                }
            }
        )
        {
        }
    }
}
```

With this given structure, querying a value in */ModelGroup* will yield
values from the specified clip “clip-group.usda”. When the active prim
is *ModelGroup/Subgroup/* any attribute value will be resolved by using
the **ancestor’s** clip information as there are no locally authored
opinions for prim *Subgroup*. However, when the prim is
*ModelGroup/Subgroup/Model* then the active clip will be
“clip-model.usda”, i,e the descendant will override the ancestor, it is
stronger. In this example, with clip sets authored on each prim, all
value resolution is performed with value clips. The locally authored
opinions are stronger than the `reference` hence the values authored in
“ref.usda” are ignored.

#### Missing Values in Clip Set

A clip set has “gaps” if some of the value clips in the set do not
contain authored time samples for an attribute that has been declared in
the manifest.

By default, if a value clip does not contain time samples for an
attribute, a time sample at the clip’s active time will be generated
using the default value for the attribute authored in the clip manifest.
If no default value has been authored, an `empty sentinel` value will be
returned.

#### Interpolating Missing Values in Clip Set

Clip sets can optionally be interpolated by using the setting
`interpolateMissingClipValues`. When enabled, if a query is made at a
time when the clip set has a gap, and the attribute does not have a
default value specified in the manifest, a forward and backwards search
from the active clip at that time to find the nearest clips that contain
authored time sample values will be performed. The final value will be
interpolated from these time samples.

#### Jump Discontinuities

Jump discontinuities in the timing curve can be represented in the times
metadata by authoring two entries with the same stage time, but
different clip times. The clip time in the left-most entry is used for
time mappings up to the specified stage time, while the clip time in the
right-most entry is used for time mappings at that stage time and
afterward.

For example, if there are two authored clips and the system requires
animation from times 0 to 10 in the first clip followed by times 25 to
35 in the second clip. This could be specified with the `active` and
`times` metadata like this:

``` python
double2[] active = [(0, 0), (10, 1)]
double2[] times = [(0, 0), (10, 10), (10, 25), (20, 35)]
```

A jump discontinuity has been specified at stage time 10. For times in
the range \[0, 10), resolution will retrieve values from the first clip
at times \[0, 10). For times in the range \[10, 20\], resolution will
retrieve values from the second clip at times \[25, 35\]. Jump
discontinuities can be used for looping, for example

``` python
asset[] assetPaths = [@./clip_1.usd@]
double2[] active = [(0, 0)]
double2[] times = [(0, 0), (25, 25), (25, 0), (50, 25)]
```

This shows 25 frames of animation from a clip being looped from time 0
to 25, then 25 to 50.

#### Examples of using Active and Time metadata

##### Active clips

The defined assetPaths with `assetIndex` 0 and 1 will be used at times 0
and 10

``` python
asset[] assetPaths = [@./clip1.usd@. clip_2.usd]
double2[] active = [(0,0),(10,1)]
```

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/clip-active.svg"
alt="Active clip metadata" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Active clip metadata</figcaption>
</figure>

##### Clip times

Following on from the previous example, but now `times` is used to
define a mapping between stage time and clip time. In this example, at
stage time 0 the clip time is mapped to clip time 5.

``` python
asset[] assetPaths = [@./clip1.usd@. clip_2.usd]
double2[] active = [(0,0),(10,1)]
double2[] times = [(0,5),(10,0)]
```

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/clip-times.svg"
alt="Clip time metadata" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Clip time metadata</figcaption>
</figure>

##### Clip Looping

``` python
asset[] assetPaths = [@./clip1.usd@. clip_2.usd]
double2[] active = [(0,0),(10,1)]
double2[] times = [(10,0),(30,20),(30,0),(50,20)]
```

In this example, extending again from the previous where looping takes
place in clip_2.usd. The first iteration of the loop is between times
\[10,30\] and then \[30,50\]. Value resolution at scene times samples 20
and 40 will result in the same value `V` being queried from the clip.

</figure>

### Fallback Values

- Each Prim has one or more [schemas](#schemas) that define properties.
- The schema lists its properties, their types, and fallback values.
- When the stage is populated, all the prims are populated with
  properties coming from their schemas.
- If the user hasn’t authored an opinion on a property, the fallback
  value provided via the [prim definition](#the-prim-definition) is
  consulted according to [fallback value
  resolution](#fallback-value-resolution-for-attributes).

> *Note:* The schemas of each prim present in the stage must be
> registered before the stage is populated, otherwise an accurate
> fallback value for an attribute defined via a schema cannot be
> provided if the schema is missing.

As an example, on loading a file that has a Sphere containing no
authored attribute, the stage population will have to assume a fallback
value. With the provided schema, or equivalent, the fallback value for,
as an example, the “radius” can be queried.

#### Sphere Example

Here is an example of how we would define a new type called Sphere. The
important part is that an attribute is defined with a fallback value.

``` python
class Sphere "Sphere" (  
    doc = """Defines a sphere primitive."""  
)
{  
    double radius = 1 (  
        doc = """Indicates the sphere's radius.”””    
    )
}
```

Now that we know how to define a Sphere, the prim can be created using
the `def` specifier. This prim will contain all the properties declared
in its schemas.

``` python
 def Sphere "CueBall"  
 {

 }
```

By using this definition, “CueBall” has an attribute called radius of
type double with a fallback value of 1. Value resolution will result in
a value for “CueBall.radius” of 1, as no value has been authored.

If no authored schema is available for the attribute then an
`empty sentinel` value is returned.

### Blocked Attributes

An attribute can also be blocked. When a spec is marked as blocked,
weaker opinions on that spec are discarded. If the strongest opinion is
marked as blocked, and a fallback value is available, the fallback value
is returned. Otherwise, an `empty sentinel` value is returned instead.
For more information on value blocks, see [value
blocks](#default-variantvalue-specialized-type). An example of
validating the blocking capability with respect to accessing the default
value can be seen below.

``` python
    def _process_default(self, spec: Spec):
        """ Process the default value of the spec """
        if (def_value := spec.fields.get("default")) is not None:
            if(def_value.type == ValueType.ValueBlock):
                return self._process_fallback(spec)
            else:
                return def_value.value
        return None
```

In the following example the radius is blocked, any authored opinion on
radius will be discarded and the fallback processed.

``` python
def Sphere "CueBall"
{
    double radius.timeSamples = {
        1: 2.0,
        2: 2.5
    }
}

def "RedBall" (
    references = </CueBall>
)
{
    double radius = None
}
```

Individual Time samples can also be blocked

``` python
#usda 1.0

def Sphere "CueBall"
{
    double radius.timeSamples = {
        1: None,
        2: 2.5
    }
 }
```

Note that the per-timeSample-blocking ability does not allow us to
sparsely override timeSamples, i.e. in the following example requesting
a value at any time for “RedBall” will result in a `ValueBlock`
resolving to fallback value if authored or a sentinel value being
returned.

``` python
#usda 1.0

def Sphere "CueBall"
{
    double radius.timeSamples = {
        1: 2.0,
        2: 2.5
    }
}

def "RedBall" (
    references = </CueBall>
)
{
    # This will force all time samples on RedBall to behave as Blocked
    double radius.timeSamples = {
        1: None,
    }
}
```

## Relationships and Attribute Connections

*Relationship targets* are modeled as a list op of paths set on the
[`targetPaths`](#targetpaths-listopobjectpath-specialized-type) metadata
field of the relationship spec.

While the semantics of what to do with a relationship target are up to
the system querying it, the run-time shall provide the means to retrieve
either the *raw* targets (i.e., those in the resolved listop of the
`targetPaths` metadata field) or the *forwarded* targets, which
recursively follow the relationship to the end of a target chain (a prim
or an attribute).

Retrieving the raw targets is equivalent to retrieving the resolved
value of the `targetPaths` metadata field. Retrieving the set of
forwarded targets can be done through the following algorithm:

**Input**: A scene object containing a set of paths in a listop on the
`targetPaths` metadata field

**Output**: A list of paths denoting the resolved forwarded relationship
targets

    get_forwarded_relationship_target_paths(scene_object) -> [resolved_paths]:
        # resolve the list_op to get the raw targets
        paths_listop = scene_object.resolve("targetPaths")
        resolved_targets = []
        for path in paths_listop:
            # if it's a prim or attribute path no forwarding required
            if is_prim_path(path) or is_attribute_path(path):
                resolved_targets.append(path)
            else:
                # if it's a relationship, the relationship has a listop
                # of targets, and we need to look at each of those and
                # forward
                sub_resolved_targets = get_relationship_target_paths(
                    get_scene_object(path), true)
                resolved_targets += sub_resolved_targets

        return resolved_targets

For example, consider the following scene description:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "foo" {
  rel myRel = [</foo/bar>, </baz.bazrel>]

  def "bar" {
  }
}

def "baz" {
  rel bazrel = [</foo/foobar>, </foo/foobar/barbaz>]
}
```

Using the algorithm above, the final set of targets for `/foo.myRel`
would be `[/foo/bar, /foo/foobar, /foo/foobar/barbaz]`.

*Attribute connections* are modeled as a list op of paths that relate an
attribute to a set of targets and are set on the metadata field
[`connectionPaths`](#connectionpaths-listopobjectpath-specialized-type)
on the attribute spec.

Connection targets, unlike relationship targets are resolved to raw
targets and not forwarded. Retrieving these targets is equivalent to
retrieving the resolved value of the `connectionPaths` metadata field.

## Interpolation

Attribute values can be associated with time samples and, with the
appropriate interpolation flag set at the stage level, can be
interpolated to retrieve the correct value at the queried time. At the
stage level, two interpolation types can be specified:

- Held
- Linear

These values are used when time samples are authored. Spline evaluation
is performed using its own specified interpolation method. If both time
samples and splines are authored together, time samples will take
precedence. When using time samples, if no interpolation method is
specified at the stage level, the default interpolation is Linear.
Splines interpolate is explicitly authored.

Specifying the stage level interpolation value is implementation
defined.

In the example of the Cue ball prim, the radius of the Sphere can be
animated using Held or Linear as defined. Each pair is a time and value
matching the attribute type.

``` python
def Sphere “CueBall”
{  
    double radius.timeSamples = {
        1:0,  
        5:3.14,
        10:6.28
    }
}
```

An example of bezier spline based interpolation with curve interpolation
at the knots with time (1,5,10) and Values (0,3.14,6.28) using default
tangents. The end of time extrapolation is using `Held`.

``` python
def Sphere "sphere"
{
    double radius.spline = {  
        bezier,  
        pre: sloped(0),  
        post: held(0),
        1: 0; pre (1, 1); post curve (1, 1),
        5: 3.14; pre (1, 1); post curve (1, 1),
        10: 6.28; pre (1, 1); post curve (1, 1),
    }  
}
```

### Held

The value is held to the nearest previous value at the authored time.
This value will remain constant at subsequent time codes until another
value is authored. For time codes before or after the authored time
samples the value will remain “held” until the next authored sample.

For example:

``` python
def Sphere “CueBall”
{  
    double radius.timeSamples = {
        100:10,
        200:20
    }
}
```

Queries from 100-199 will return “10”. Queries earlier than 100 will
also return “10”. Queries from 200 and beyond will return “20”

### Linear

Basic linear interpolation is supported for the following
[types](#foundational-data-types):

- half
- float
- double
- timecode
- matrix2d
- matrix3d
- matrix4d
- half2 / float2 / double2
- half3 / float3 / double3
- half4 / float4 / double4
- quatd (via quaternion slerp)
- quatf (via quaternion slerp)
- quath (via quaternion slerp)

For time samples after the last authored sample, or for types that are
not supported by linear, the computed value will behave as if Held.

alt="Linear Interpolation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Linear Interpolation</figcaption>
</figure>

### Spline

Animation is defined using the following curve types:

- Bézier
- Hermite

Time based evaluation is performed across the length of the curve.

Splines support the following [data types](#foundational-data-types):

- half
- float
- double

#### Interpolation

Spline interpolation is how values are determined between the knots.
There are four types of interpolation:

- value-block

- held

- linear

- curve

- If the interpolation type is value-block, there is explicitly no value
  between the knots.

- If the interpolation type is held, the value is held constant until
  the next knot.

- If the interpolation type is linear, the value linearly interpolated
  between the knot’s values.

- If the interpolation type is curve, then value is computed based on
  the knot’s values and tangents, and the spline’s curve type.

> *Note:* A spline has one curve type; it does not vary between curve
> segments.

A reference implementation of spline interpolation can be found in
[AnimX](https://github.com/Autodesk/animx).

#### Tangents

This specification uses the prefixes `pre` and `post` to define
something happening before or after in the time dimension. Similar
nomenclature uses the prefixes `left` and `right`, or `in` and `out`.

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/tangent_definition.svg"
alt="Tangent Definition" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Tangent Definition</figcaption>
</figure>

Tangents take the slope form. Slope is equal to the height divided by
length. A positive slope increases in value as time increases,
conversely a negative slope will decrease as time increases.

Other tangents forms exist such as using height instead of slope. Height
based tangents typically differ by having negative values for upward
sloping `pre` tangents. Conversion between tangent forms is left as an
implementation detail.

Please reference [Cubic Splines Specialized
Type](#cubic-splines-specialized-type) for more information.

#### Continuity

Although not stored as part of the spline or knot data, continuity
classes C0 and C1 can be inferred. Discontinuity is supported through
the usage of **dual valued knots**. Dual valued knots are defined with a
**pre-value**, which is the value encountered when approaching from a
lower time than the time value of the knot, and a **value** which is the
value of the knot at the knot’s time, and for interpolating beyond.
Clearly, if the pre-value at the knot differs from the value, there is a
discontinuity at that time.

<figure>

</figure>

| Continuity | Continuous Value | Continuous Slope | Comment |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Discontinuous | No | No | Dual Valued Knots, or Value-Blocks |
| C0 | Yes | No | Tangents With Different Directions |
| C1 | Yes | Yes | Identical Slopes |

> *Note:*
>
> 1.  In the case of extrapolation with type `TsExtrapLoopReset`, a
>     discontinuity potentially exists at the loop points.
> 2.  Held values will also introduce discontinuity.
> 3.  Inner loops can create discontinuity via the value offset.

#### Looping

Extrapolation determines the values before the first knot or after the
last. Often this is used to perform looping.

##### Extrapolating loops

These use the entire spline (from first to last knot), and repeat it
infinitely before and/or after the knots.

Extrapolation can take the following forms for both Pre and Post
Extrapolation.

| Type          | Comment                                            |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| block         | No value                                           |
| held          | Constant Value                                     |
| linear        | Linear Interpolation based on edged knots          |
| sloped        | Linear interpolation with specified slope          |
| looprepeat    | Knot curve repeated, curve is offset so ends meet. |
| loopreset     | Curve repeated exactly, discontinuous joins.       |
| looposcillate | Like Reset, but every other copy reversed          |

Extrapolating loops work across the whole authored spline. The default
extrapolation type is `Held`.

###### Example loops

| Syntax | Example |  | Comment |
|:---|:---|----|:---|
| pre/post : **sloped**, | pre : sloped(0) |  | 0: Bezier 1. Hermite |
| pre/post: **linear** | post : linear |  | Linear interpolation |
| pre/post: **held** | pre : held |  | Held |
| pre/post **loop** | post : loop oscillate |  | Looping enabled, followed by loop type |

###### Held Extrapolation

Retains the value of the end key. Held is the default extrapolation
type. Typically used to maintain a constant animation, for example an
object coming to rest and remaining at rest.

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/held_extrap.svg"
alt="Held Extrapolation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Held Extrapolation</figcaption>
</figure>

###### Linear Extrapolation

Extrapolated value is calculated from the final tangent. It projects
linearly to the end time frame. Commonly used to continue the animation,
for example a car after a complex maneuver carries on moving formally in
the same direction. `linear Sloped Extrapolation` is similar but a slope
can be defined instead of being inferred by the first or last tangent.

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/linear_extrap.svg"
alt="linear Extrapolation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">linear Extrapolation</figcaption>
</figure>

###### Oscillate Extrapolation

The Oscillate setting repeats the animation curve by reversing its
values, and therefore shape, with each cycle. Examples include
animations where states switch back and forth, such as the motion of a
piston.

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/oscillate_extrap.svg"
alt="Oscillate" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Oscillate</figcaption>
</figure>

###### Repeat Extrapolation

Repeats the animation curve infinitely, except it appends the curve’s
last key’s value to the value of the first key’s original curve. This
provides a seamless loop, but with an offset applied, thus producing a
progressive loop. For example a character walking upstairs. The authored
curve would be for one step on the stairs, the extrapolation will
provide the result for each subsequent steps up the stairs.

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/repeat_extrap.svg"
alt="Repeat Extrapolation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Repeat Extrapolation</figcaption>
</figure>

###### Reset Extrapolation

Represent the curve as a repeat infinitely, potentially creating a
discontinuity. These curves create a seamless loop, such as a walk cycle
or a rotating fan.

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/reset_extrap.svg"
alt="Reset Extrapolation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Reset Extrapolation</figcaption>
</figure>

##### Inner loops

Inner loops specify a prototype region, which is repeated a finite
number of times before and / or after the prototype region.

Inner loops are defined as part of a subset of the spline, known as a
prototype.

| Name         | Type   | Comment             |
|:-------------|:-------|:--------------------|
| protoStart   | Time   | Start knot of loop  |
| protoEnd     | Time   | End time of loop    |
| numPreLoops  | Int32  | Number of pre loops |
| numPostLoops | Int32  | Number of pos loops |
| valueOffset  | double | Value offset        |

`protoStart` must be located at a Knot, `protoEnd` specifies the end
timeSample. Inner loops only support **Continue extrapolation method**

| Prefix | Values | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| loop | (start, end, preloops, postloops, valueOffset) | loop:(0, 60.0, 2, 2, 0) |

Inner loops support the `continue` method.

###### Continue

The authored curve is copied from the `protoStart` to the end time
sample, `protoEnd`. The start position must coincide with a knot. The
curve is then pre and post copied base d on the `numPreLoops` and
`numPreLoops` values. As the end time sample doesn’t always include a
knot, the shape of the curve could be altered due to differing tangents.
This method provides fine control over how extrapolation of the curve is
performed.

| Example | Description |
|:---|:---|
| loop:(10.0, 50.0, 0, 1, 0) | Authored curve, post copied once between timeSamples {10, 50}. |

#### Non-monotonic Curves

A spline can use cubic Beziér curves for its shape. This shape
represents a function that maps times to values. In the general case, it
is possible for cubic Beziér curves to have shapes that are looped or
S-shaped, that “double back” on themselves in time, giving a curve that
has more than one value at some time or times. These shapes would
violate the notion of a continuous single-valued function of time. These
non-monotonic curves (sometimes referred to as regressive curves) refer
to shapes where time values along the curve may decrease locally,
resulting in non-monotonic progression. This usually happens when the
extrapolated time range implied by a tangent precedes the previous
knot’s time (for pre tangents), or exceeds the next knot’s time (for
post tangents).

<figure>
<img src="images/value_resolution/regressive.svg"
alt="Non-monotonic Curves" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Non-monotonic Curves</figcaption>
</figure>

This situation can be visualized as a segment of the spline bending back
toward earlier time values, which creates a kind of temporal regression.
Although rare, near-vertical tangents may be intentional to indicate
extremely rapid changes; however, actual reversal in time (i.e.,
regression) produces evaluation errors or visual artifacts.

To prevent this, implementations should provide anti-regression
functionality when authoring splines. Unless explicitly disabled, the
anti-regression algorithm can modify the magnitude of authored tangents
when necessary to ensure that the resulting curve is a single-valued
function of time.

At evaluation time, if a spline is not a function of time, an
implementation must correct it by shortening the tangents until the
temporal regression is resolved. The tangents should be shrunk in
proportion until the spline is a continuous function of time.

#### Custom Data

Custom data is supported on knots as specified
[here](#spline-specialized-type).

# Schemas

## Scope

This section specifies the extension of well-known metadata fields to
specs as well as ascribing a type and properties onto a prim via
*schemas*. Both of these are used to drive downstream behaviors in the
system.

This section does not specify the mechanism by which these extensions
are defined or ingested into the runtime system and leaves that up to
the specific implementation.

## Extension Metadata Fields

Schema domains may define semantics for fields introduced as [extension
metadata](#extension-metadata-fields). However, note that properties are
preferred and recommended.

### Core Metadata Extensions

Four additional metadata fields are added as extensions to the core
schema definitions. These fields affect [stage
population](#stage-population), [composition](#composition), and [value
resolution](#value-resolution).

#### fallbackPrimTypes: `dictionary`

Map of schema names that, if not registered, should be populated as
another more widely available schema. The value type of each entry of
the dictionary should be a token array. It should contain no other
entries. Both keys and elements in the token array should be valid type
names, but this shouldn’t be considered a value restriction. The values
in each token array define a preference-ordered list of schema types to
substitute, if available.

Applies To: `Layer Specs`

Fallback Value: `{}`

Example:

``` json
{
    "DepartmentSphere" : ["FacilitySphere", "Sphere"]
}
```

Fallback prim type semantics should not be applied at the layer level
and instead shall be interpreted on the composed prim.

#### apiSchemas: `listop<token>`

Identifiers of applied schemas, or identifier/instance pairs of multiple
applied schemas separated by a `:`.

Note that while `apiSchemas`’s elements are intended to follow the
identifier or identifier/instance pair pattern, this is not a formal
requirement of the layer document model.

Applies To: `Prim Specs`

Fallback Value: `[]`

Applied schemas have no semantic meaning at the layer level and instead
shall be interpreted on the composed prim.

##### clips: `dictionary`

Defines the clip sets on the prim. See [value clips](#value-clips).

Applies to: `Prim Specs`

Fallback Value: `{}`

##### clipSets: `listop<string>`

Listop defining the sets of clips used for a prim. See [value
clips](#value-clips)

Applies to: `Prim Specs`

Fallback Value: `[]`

## Schema Types

Schemas are structured types that ascribe properties to a composed prim,
which are used to drive downstream behaviors. These types can be
authored onto prim specs to give that spec an opinion about what
structured data the composed prim will receive. While authoring opinions
about schemas are done on the prim spec, the resulting composed value
shall only be interpreted by the runtime system on the composed prim. If
a composed prim has an authored schema type, it will be imbued with
additional properties defined by those authored schemas.

A schema can have one of two types:

- Typed
- Applied

A prim spec may have at most one typed schema authored onto it, but may
have as many applied schemas authored onto it as it needs to fulfill its
intended functionality in the stage. In this way, the composed prim
shall have at most one typed schema and as many applied schemas
associated to it as dictated by composing these authored fields.

### Typed Schemas

A *typed schema* defines the concrete type of a composed prim. Opinions
about this type are authored to the `typeName` [metadata
field](#typename-token). This value is resolved via
[composition](#composing-prims) to result in a composed prim that either
has a type or is typeless.

A typed schema definition must contain:

- A name for the schema
- A definition of zero or more properties

These properties are considered part of the [composed prim
definition](#stage-population) for a prim of that type.

Typed schemas may be *abstract* or *concrete*. An abstract typed schema,
like a concrete schema, optionally provides the definition of a set of
properties, but a composed prim shall not be allowed to have a composed
`typeName` value that refers to the name of an abstract typed schema.
Schema types not defined as explicitly abstract shall be treated as
concrete.

A typed schema may optionally *inherit* from *one* base schema. This
results in the final type of the composed prim containing all the
properties defined through its inheritance chain.

If a composed prim has a typed schema authored in the `typeName` field,
queries about that prim’s type should return whether it is of that type
or not, and should include the inheritance chain when making the
determination. Although a composed prim is not permitted to be defined
with an abstract typed schema, introspection of that prim should still
allow determination whether a prim “is of” that type or not (i.e.,
defined with a concrete typed schema that inherits from an abstract
typed schema). That is, a prim is of type `T` if the prim’s `typeName`
field value is equal to `T` or the name of any concrete or abstract
ancestor of `T`.

Consider the following generic schema definition in `json`:

``` json
{
    "Foo": {
        "isTyped": true,
        "isAbstract": true,
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "fooprop",
                "typeName": "int",
                "default": 0
            }
        ]
    },
    "Bar": {
        "isTyped": true,
        "inherits": "Foo",
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "barprop",
                "typeName": "float",
                "default": 1.0
            }
        ]
    },
    "Baz": {
        "isTyped": true,
        "inherits": "Foo"
    }
}
```

And a sample scene description using that schema definition:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def Bar "bar1" {
    string bar1prop = ""
}

def Baz "baz1" {
    vector2f baz1prop = (0.0, 0.0)
}
```

After composition of this simple stage, the prim `bar1` would have an
authored `typeName` of `Bar` with three properties defined for it at the
paths `/bar1.bar1prop`, `/bar1.barprop`, and `/bar1.fooprop`. The prim
`baz1` would have an authored `typeName` of `Baz` with two properties
defined for it at the paths `/baz1.baz1prop` and `baz1.fooprop`. If
these prims were introspected, the following conclusions could be drawn:

- `baz1` is of type `Baz`
- `baz1` is of type `Foo`
- `baz1` is not of type `Bar`
- `bar1` is of type `Bar`
- `bar1` is of type `Foo`
- `bar1` is not of type `Baz`

If the strongest opinion on the `typeName` field for a composed prim is
either an abstract schema name or the name of a schema that cannot be
identified by the system as a valid schema type name, then the prim is
typeless.

Note that the above generic schema definition contained fallback values
for its property definitions. As described in [value
resolution](#value-resolution), these values participate in value
resolution and will be returned if no authored value for the property
exists. This is important in that schema definitions participate in the
value resolution of scene description - any composed prim defined with a
schema type that cannot be identified by the system cannot have its
scene description properly interpreted due to the missing fallback
values.

### Applied Schemas

An *applied schema* is similar to a typed schema in that it defines a
set of properties, but unlike typed schemas they don’t imbue the
composed prim with a type. Applied schemas define the properties
required to realize an aspect or feature separate from a prim’s concrete
type. Prim specs may have multiple applied schemas *applied* to them,
allowing a composed prim to exhibit multiple different aspects that
contribute semantic meaning in different processing scenarios. Applied
schemas are applied by authoring the `apiSchemas` [metadata
field](#usd-schema). Like any other metadata field, the values for each
contributing opinion are composed into the final value for the composed
prim. Since `apiSchemas` is a list op based field, its final value is
determined by standard list op resolution [rules](#list-operations).
Introspection of a composed prim with one or more applied schemas should
be able to determine if that prim “has an” applied schema of a specific
type applied to it.

An applied schema can be defined as *single* or *multiple*. A single
applied schema may only be applied to a composed prim once. A multiple
applied schema may be applied to a composed prim many times, and each
application is associated with a unique *instance name*, which forms a
key part of the property namespace. Whereas a composed prim receives the
properties of a single applied schema directly, a composed prim receives
the properties of a multiple applied schema through a process of forming
the property name by taking the instance name with which it was applied
and placing it in a placeholder defined in the schema definition. It is
implementation dependent how to define this placeholder. An instance of
a multiple applied schema is recorded in scene description in the
following form:

    Colon <- ':'

``` peg
RecordedMultipleAppliedSchemaName <- MultipleAppliedSchemaName Colon InstanceName
```

`InstanceName` must follow property identifier rules specified
[here](#grammar-definition). That is:

``` peg
InstanceName <- PropertyName
```

``` peg
PropertyName <- Identifier (Colon Identifier)*
```

Note that according to the above grammar definition, instance names
themselves may contain multiple namespaces (e.g., identifiers separated
by `:`). Consider the following generic schema definition in `json`,
where `<instance_name>` defines the placeholder for where the instance
name will be applied to result in the fully resolved property name:

``` json
{
    "FooBar": {
        "isTyped": false,
        "isMultiple": false,
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "foobarprop",
                "typeName": "half",
                "default": 0.5
            }
        ]
    },
    "BarBaz": {
        "isTyped": false,
        "isMultiple": true,
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "<instance_name>:barbazprop",
                "typeName": "string",
                "default": ""
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

And a simple scene description using that definition:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "foo" (
    apiSchemas = ["FooBar"]
){
    vector3d pt
}

def "bar" (
    apiSchemas = ["FooBar", "BarBaz:my_instance"]
)
{
    string anotherString = "default"
}
```

After composing this simple stage, the prim `foo` would have an authored
`apiSchemas` value of `["FooBar"]` indicating that a single applied
schema has been applied to the prim at path `/foo`. The resulting prim
would have two properties defined for it at the paths `/foo.pt` and
`/foo.foobarprop`. The prim `bar` would have an authored `apiSchemas`
value of `["FooBar", "BarBaz:my_instance"]`, indicating that two schemas
have been applied to the prim, one single applied schema and one
multiple applied schema with an instance name of `my_instance`. The
resulting prim would have three properties defined for it at the paths
`/bar.anotherString`, `/bar.foobarprop`, and
`/bar.my_instance:barbazprop`. If these prims were introspected, the
following conclusions could be drawn:

- `foo` has a `FooBar` applied to it
- `foo` does not have any instances of `BarBaz` applied to
- `bar` has a `FooBar` applied to it
- `bar` has one instance of `BarBaz` applied to it, with an instance
  name of `my_instance`

#### Schema Inclusions

Any typed or applied schema may introduce a set of *inclusions*, or
rules that specify:

- A set of *built-ins*: additional applied schemas that should be
  applied when the defining schema is associated with a prim in the
  context of a composed stage. This set must only be applied schemas.
- A set of *auto-applies*: a set of typed or applied schemas that the
  defining schema should be applied to, should the prim in the context
  of a composed stage be of that type or have any of those applied
  schemas applied to it

The set of built-ins may include multiple applied schemas, with the
following restrictions:

- If a typed or single applied schema contains a multiple applied schema
  in their built-in set, these multiple applied schemas must be named
  instances (e.g., `MyMultipleAppliedSchema::instanceName`
  vs. `MyMultipleAppliedSchema`).
- Multiple applied schemas may refer to another multiple applied schema
  by type or by named instance in their built-in set.
  - If the multiple applied schema is referred to by type, the built-in
    is applied using the same instance name as the defining multiple
    applied schema is given when applied.
  - If the multiple applied schema is referred to with an instance name,
    the built-in is applied by prefixing the instance name used to apply
    the defining multiple applied schema to the referred instance name
    of the target multiple applied schema.

The set of auto-applies may include multiple applied schemas, but if
present, must be supplied as named instances.

Consider an additional multiple applied schema to the examples above:

``` json
{
    "FooBar": {
        "isTyped": false,
        "isMultiple": false,
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "foobarprop",
                "typeName": "half",
                "default": 0.5
            }
        ],
        "inclusions": {
            "auto_applies": ["BazFoo:bazfooinstance"]
        }
    },
    "BarBaz": {
        "isTyped": false,
        "isMultiple": true,
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "<instance_name>:barbazprop",
                "typeName": "string",
                "default": ""
            }
        ]
    },
    "BazFoo": {
        "isTyped": false,
        "isMultiple": true,
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "bazfooprop:<instance_name>",
                "typeName": "int",
                "default": 1
            }
        ],
        "inclusions": {
            "built_ins": ["BarBaz"]
        }
    }
}
```

If `FooBar` is applied to a prim “Foo” as in the following sample scene
description:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "foo" (
    apiSchemas = ["FooBar"]
) {
}
```

then the composed prim at the path `/foo` will have the following
applied schemas:

- `FooBar`
- `BazFoo:bazfooinstance`
- `BarBaz:bazfooinstance`

#### Override Properties

Any schema may have an opinion about the value of a property, and the
schema with the strongest opinion shall end up providing that value. The
ordering of schema opinions is dictated by the
[order](#the-prim-definition) on the composed prim. However, there are
cases when a schema includes another as a built-in where it needs to
override the value of a property, e.g., to include a more reasonable
fallback value. Any schema may declare zero or more override properties
with the following restrictions:

- The declaration of the property must have the same type of the
  property it overrides
- The declaration of the property may have a different variability, but
  it must be ignored
- The declaration of the property must override the same property
  defined in both directly and indirectly included built-ins

Note that a schema declaring an override property doesn’t *define* the
property, instead it is treated like an *over* to the property defined
by some other schema.

#### The Prim Definition

A prim spec can have both a typed schema and many applied schemas
authored onto it, and these schemas may come with additional inclusions,
whether they be built-ins or auto-applies. The final set of schemas
present on the prim when composed make up the *prim definition*, and as
such, determine the final set of properties present on the prim as well
as the ordering in which to resolve the fallback value of the property
if no stronger authored value is present.

Each schema has an associated prim definition. The prim definition is
built for a schema using the following algorithm:

**Inputs**: Name of the schema

**Outputs**: Prim Definition for the schema

    build_prim_definition(schema_name) -> PrimDefinition:
      # create the prim definition object
      # and initialize its properties with that of the defining schema
      prim_definition = create_prim_definition_object()
      prim_definition.schemas.append(schema_name)
      prim_definition.properties = get_properties_from_schema_type(schema_name)
      override_properties = get_override_properties_from_schema_type(schema_name)

      # get the direct schema inclusions
      built_ins = get_built_in_inclusion_list(schema_name)
      auto_applies = get_auto_applies_inclusion_list(schema_name)
      schema_inclusions = built_ins + auto_applies
      prim_definition.schemas += schema_inclusions

      # for each schema inclusion in the order above
      # build its prim definition (if not already built)
      # then compose that prim definition into this one as a weaker prim definition
      for applied_schema in schema_inclusions:
        weaker_prim_definition = build_prim_definition(applied_schema)
        compose_prim_definition(prim_definition, weaker_prim_definition)

      # now compose in each override property value into this prim definition
      # except the variability metadata field, which cannot be overridden
      for override_property in override_properties:
        for metadata_field in override_property.metadata_fields:
          if !is_variability_metadata_field(metadata_field):
            prim_definition.properties[override_property].set_field(metadata_field,
              override_property.get_field(metadata_field))

      return prim_definition

    compose_prim_definition(stronger_prim_definition, weaker_prim_definition):
      # append all schemas
      stronger_prim_definition.schemas += weaker_prim_definition.schemas

      # for each property in the weaker prim definition, determine if the
      # stronger prim definition has it, if not, add it to the stronger
      # prim definition.  If the strong prim definition does have it, and
      # the property, check the value of the `default` and `hidden` metadata fields
      # if the stronger property definition has a value for it, skip, otherwise
      # set the value in the stronger property definition
      for prop in weaker_prim_definition.properties:
        if !stronger_prim_definition.has_property(prop):
          stronger_prim_definition.propeerties.add(prop)

        metadata_fields = ["default", "hidden"]
        for metadata_field in metadata_fields:
          if stronger_prim_definition.properties[prop].has_field(metadata_field):
            continue

          stronger_prim_definition.properties[prop].set_field(metadata_field,
            weaker_prim_definition.properties[prop].get_field(metadata_field))

The final prim definition for a composed prim is constructed as follows:

- Construct a prim definition for the composed prim with properties
  determined by composition
- Compose the schema prim definition as a weaker prim definition onto
  that prim definition

The final prim definition for a composed prim determines the final set
of properties that are included for that prim. Note that the final order
of schemas for that prim is important, as it will be used to resolve the
fallback values of properties for those that do not have authored
values. See [fallback value resolution](#fallback-value-resolution) for
further details.

For instance, consider the prim spec in the following scene description,
using the schema definitions above:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def Bar "myFoo" (
    apiSchemas = ["FooBar"]
){
    double myFoo:prop = 5.0
}
```

In this case, after composition the prim at path `/myFoo` would have
four properties defined for it:

- `/myFoo.myFoo:prop`
- `/myFoo.barprop`
- `/myFoo.fooprop`
- `/myFoo.foobarprop`

and introspection of the prim would yield the following:

- `myFoo` is of type `Bar`
- `myFoo` is of type `Foo`
- `myFoo` has a `FooBar` applied to it

Now consider adding an inclusion to the `FooBar` definition above:

    {
        "FooBar": {
            "isTyped": false,
            "isMultiple": false,
            "properties": [
                {
                    "name": "foobarprop",
                    "typeName": "half",
                    "default": 0.5
                }
            ],
            "inclusions": {
                "built_ins": ["BarBaz:myInstance"]
            }
        }
    }

Using the same sample scene description, the prim at path `/myFoo` would
then have five properties defined for it:

- `/myFoo.myFoo:prop`
- `/myFoo.barprop`
- `/myFoo.fooprop`
- `/myFoo.foobarprop`
- `/myFoo.myInstance:barbazprop`

and introspection of the prim would yield the following:

- `myFoo` is of type `Bar`
- `myFoo` is of type `Foo`
- `myFoo` has a `FooBar` applied to it
- `myFoo` has a `BarBaz` instance applied to it with the instance name
  `myInstance`

#### Fallback Value Resolution for Attributes

The prim definition for a composed prim defines how to evaluate the
fallback value of an attribute. If a fallback value has to be evaluated,
it shall be evaluated in the following order:

- The value provided by the type of the prim (i.e., the typed schema
  associated with the prim)
- For each applied schema in the ordered set of applied schemas as
  determined above:
  - The value provided by the applied schema
- The fallback value of the `default` metadata field (the [unauthorable
  empty sentinel](#default-variantvalue-specialized-type))

Note the above is the order in which the prim definition was composed;
later schemas in the list were composed as weaker opinions such that the
type of the prim always provides the strongest fallback value followed
by the applied schemas in the order they were composed in.

In the above example, the schema ordering for the prim definition would
be

`[Bar, FooBar, BarBaz:myInstance]`

and the schemas would be visited in that order to retrieve a fallback
value for an unauthored property.

If instead `FooBar` had defined an `auto_applies` inclusion as well, for
example:

    {
        "FooBar": {
            "isTyped": false,
            "isMultiple": false,
            "properties": [
                {
                    "name": "foobarprop",
                    "typeName": "half",
                    "default": 0.5
                }
            ],
            "inclusions": {
                "built_ins": ["BarBaz:myInstance"],
                "auto_applies": ["BazFoo:otherInstance"]
            }
        }
    }

then the schema ordering for the prim definition would be
`[Bar, FooBar, BarBaz:myInstance, BazFoo:otherInstance]`.

## Core Schema Types

A number of schemas are introduced as part of this specification to
extend the core schema data model. These schemas include those for
[color](#color) and [collections](#collections).

# Color

In order to ensure consistent and accurate colors, color spaces may be
used and defined.

Color space information may be specified for:

1.  Scene-referred colors.

    The *source color space* may be specified for any authored color
    attribute or asset path identifying a texture or other external
    color-containing asset.

2.  Rendering/lighting calculations involving colors.

    These colors are part of Render Settings and not specified here.

## Supported Color Spaces

The canonical color spaces (and their OpenUSD tokens at the time of
writing, for reference) are:

| Data | data | This designation indicates that the asset it describes is actually not color data (e.g. an image file format being used to represent a normal or volume map, etc.), and that no color conversion of the data should be performed. |
| Unknown | unknown | This designation indicates that the color space is not known (e.g. an image file was created in a tool that did not save the color space information, or provided incorrect color space information). |

`CIE XYZ-D65` bears some additional explanation. The `D65` component in
the name is meant to indicate that values transformed to this color
space should be adapted to the D65 white point.

For backwards compatibility with older assets, OpenUSD also provides
“Raw” (raw) and “Identity” (identity) color space designations that are
equivalent to `"Data"`and `"Unknown"` designations.

See [Color Space Encodings for Texture Assets and CG
Rendering](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/ColorInterop/blob/main/Recommendations/01_TextureAssetColorSpaces/TextureAssetColorSpaces.md#summary-table--overview-of-the-recommendations)
for additional details on these color spaces.

## Core Metadata Extensions

An additional metadata field is added as an extension to the core schema
definitions. This field affects [value resolution](#value-resolution).

### colorSpace: `token`

Defines the color space applicable to the spec for which the value is
assigned. See [Color Space Inheritance and
Resolution](#color-space-inheritance-and-resolution) for further
discussion on how this metadata value affects color space value
resolution.

Applies to: `Attribute Specs`

Fallback Value: `""`

## ColorSpaceDefinitionAPI

`ColorSpaceDefinitionAPI` is an API schema for defining a custom color
space. Custom color spaces become available for use on prims or for
assignment to attributes via the
[colorSpace:name](#colorspacename-token) property on prims that have
applied `UsdColorSpaceAPI`. Since color spaces [inherit
hierarchically](#color-space-inheritance-and-resolution), a custom color
space defined on a prim will be available to all descendants of that
prim, unless overridden by a more local color space definition bearing
the same name. Locally redefining color spaces within the same layer
could be confusing, so that practice is discouraged.

### Attributes

#### name : `token`

Defines the name of the custom color space.

Variability: `uniform`

Fallback Value: `"custom"`

#### redChroma : `float2`

Defines the red chromaticity coordinate.

Variability: `varying`

Fallback Value: `(1.0, 0.0)`

#### greenChroma: `float2`

Defines the green chromaticity coordinate.

Variability: `varying`

Fallback Value: `(0.0, 1.0)`

#### blueChroma: `float2`

Defines the blue chromaticity coordinate.

Variability: `varying`

Fallback Value: `(0.0, 0.0)`

#### whitePoint: `float2`

Defines the whitepoint chromaticity coordinate.

Variability: `varying`

Fallback Value: `(0.33333333, 0.33333333)`

#### gamma: `float`

Defines the gamma value of the log section.

Variability: `varying`

Fallback Value: `1.0`

#### linearBias: `float`

Defines the linear bias of the log section.

Variability: `varying`

Fallback Value: `0.0`

## ColorSpaceAPI

`ColorSpaceAPI` is an API schema that introduces a `colorSpace` property
for authoring scene referred color space opinions. It also provides a
mechanism to determine the applicable color space within a scope through
inheritance. Accordingly, this schema may be applied to any prim to
introduce a color space at any point in a compositional hierarchy.

### Attributes

#### colorSpace:name: `token`

Describes the color space that applies to the attributes with unauthored
color spaces on this prim and its descendants.

Variability: `uniform`

Fallback Value: `""`

### Example

To specify the source color space, apply the `ColorSpaceAPI` schema and
set the `colorSpace:name` attribute to the appropriate color space
token. The `colorSpace:name` attribute is a uniform value applied to a
prim.

The following example uses `ColorSpaceAPI` to set the source color space
for a texture asset in a Shader prim.

``` python
    def Shader "usduvtexture1"
    (
        prepend apiSchemas = ["ColorSpaceAPI"]
    )
    {
        uniform token info:id = "UsdUVTexture"
        asset inputs:file = @./assetTexture.png@

        # Specify the source color space for the texture
        uniform token colorSpace:name = "srgb_p3d65_scene"

        # ... other shader attributes omitted ...
    }
```

This will set the source color space for all color attributes and
color-containing assets in the prim. If you need to provide finer-grain
details with source color spaces for specific attributes, set the
`colorSpace` metadata for the attribute.

``` python
    def Material "NewMaterial"
    (
        prepend apiSchemas = ["ColorSpaceAPI"]
    )
    {
        uniform token colorSpace:name = "srgb_p3d65_scene"

        # diffuseColor needs to specify a different color space
        color3f inputs:diffuseColor = (0.2, 0.5, 0.8) (
            colorSpace = "srgb_rec709_scene"
        )
        # ...
    }   
```

### Color Space Inheritance and Resolution

Color spaces can be specified at any level in the scene hierarchy and
are inherited by child prims. This hierarchical approach allows for:

- Setting a global color space at the root.
- Providing a color space for a subgraph of the scene.
- Specifying a color space for attributes on individual prims.
- Authoring the color on individual attributes.

The color space that should be applied to an attribute has special value
resolution semantics, and the resolution order shall be as follows:

1.  Check if the attribute has an explicitly assigned color space.
2.  Check if the attribute’s prim has the `ColorSpaceAPI` schema
    applied.
3.  Search up the hierarchy until a prim with `ColorSpaceAPI` is found.
4.  If no color space is found, an empty token is returned. In this
    case, the color space must be assumed to be the [default color
    space](#default-color-space).

The following example illustrates how color space information is
propagated and resolved. The “Root” prim has the `ColorSpaceAPI` schema
applied and specifies a color space of lin_rec709_scene. All child prims
of “Root” will inherit lin_rec709_scene as their color space unless
explicitly overridden. Three child prims are defined, with color space
resolution as follows:

- The “Material1” child prim overrides the color space from its parent.
  All attributes of “Material1” will have srgb_p3d65_scene as their
  color space.
- The “Material2” child prim does not provide an opinion for
  `colorSpace:name` and therefore will inherit the lin_rec709_scene
  color space from “Root”. Note that because “Material2” also does not
  have the `ColorSpaceAPI` schema applied, if it did provide an opinion
  for `colorSpace:name`, this would *not* be used in color space
  resolution.
- The “Material3” child prim also does not provide an opinion for
  `colorSpace:name` and therefore will inherit the lin_rec709_scene
  color space from “Root”. However, the `inputs:diffuseColor` attribute
  *does* explicitly define a color space of srgb_rec709_scene, which
  will be used as the source color space for that attribute only.

``` python
    def Xform "Root" (
        prepend apiSchemas = ["ColorSpaceAPI"]
    )
    {
        uniform token colorSpace:name = "lin_rec709_scene"

        def Material "Material1"
        (
            prepend apiSchemas = ["ColorSpaceAPI"]
        )
        {
            # Material1 overrides Root's color space with srgb_p3d65_scene
            uniform token colorSpace:name = "srgb_p3d65_scene"

            color3f inputs:diffuseColor = (0.2, 0.5, 0.8) 
        }

        def Material "Material2"
        {
            # Material2 inherits Root's lin_rec709_scene color space
            color3f inputs:diffuseColor = (0.2, 0.5, 0.8) 
        }
        
        def Material "Material3"
        {
            # Even though Material3 inherits lin_rec709_scene from Root,
            # the diffuseColor attribute specifically uses srgb_rec709_scene
            color3f inputs:diffuseColor = (0.2, 0.5, 0.8) (
                colorSpace = "srgb_rec709_scene"
            )
        }
    }
```

### Default Color Space

The default color space is Linear Rec.709. This color space is used for
the source color space for prims and attributes when color space
resolution takes place and no authored color space is found.

# Collections

Collections are an [applied schema](#applied-schemas) that combine
relationships with expansion rules to identify its member scene objects.
Relationships specify targets via composed path list operations.
Collections expand this concept by using a pair of relationships, one to
define a set of paths to *include* in the collection and one to define a
set of paths to *exclude* from the collection. This mechanism can be
used to include a group of prims from the scene while excluding certain
children from that included group.

Collections are introduced onto a prim via the `CollectionAPI` multiple
applied schema, allowing a prim to contain multiple collections with
different instance names referring to different sets of included /
excluded objects.

## CollectionAPI

The `CollectionAPI` multiple applied schema introduces the ability to
define a pair of included / excluded relationships to objects in a
scene.

### Attributes

#### expansionRule: `token`

Describes how paths that are included in the collection are evaluated to
determine the collection’s members.

Variability: `uniform`

Allowed Values: `"explicitOnly"`, `"expandPrims"`,
`"expandPrimsAndProperties"`

Fallback Value: `"expandPrims"`

#### includeRoot: `bool`

Specifies if the collection should include the absolute root path in the
collection’s included target paths. A separate attribute is required
because relationships [cannot explicitly
target](#speculative-objectpath-as-a-core-specialized-type) the absolute
root path.

Variability: `uniform`

Fallback Value: `false`

#### includes: `rel[]`

Defines the list of relationship targets that will be included in this
collection. These relationship targets can include prims and properties.

Fallback Value: `[]`

#### excludes: `rel[]`

Defines the list of relationship targets that will be excluded from the
collection based on the context of the included group. These
relationship targets can include prims and properties, but may not
target a property referring to another collection.

Fallback Value: `[]`

#### collection:\<instance_name\>: `opaque`

Defines the property that can be referenced to allow a collection to
include another collection. If a relationship target to a collection is
added to the `includes` group, the runtime must consider the `includes`
list of that collection in its own set of rules to determine collection
membership (recursively).

## Authoring and Evaluating Collections

Authoring collection instances on a prim is done by applying the
`CollectionAPI` multiple applied schema with an instance name and
authoring the `includes` and `excludes` relationship targets (and the
`expansionRule` and `includeRoot` attributes, if applicable). Consider
the following scene description:

``` python
over "foo" {
    over "bar" (
        prepend apiSchemas = "CollectionAPI:rooms"
    )
    {
        rel collection:rooms:includes = [
            </foo/bar/office>
        ]
    }
}
```

In this scene description, and instance `rooms` of the `CollectionAPI`
schema has been applied to the prim at path `/foo/bar`. The `includes`
targets includes a child prim of `/foo/bar` (`office`). Since the
fallback value for `expansionRule` is `expandPrims` (see more below),
all child prims of `/foo/bar/office` will be included in the collection
instance.

The author may exclude certain child prims using the `excludes` rule on
the collection instance. For example:

``` python
over "foo" {
    over "bar" (
        prepend apiSchemas = "CollectionAPI:rooms"
    )
    {
        rel collection:rooms:includes = [
            </foo/bar/office>
        ]
        rel collection:rooms:excludes = [
            </foo/bar/office/bookshelf>
        ]
    }
}
```

In the above case, all the child prims of `/foo/bar/office` will be
included in the `rooms` collection instance *except* for
`/foo/bar/office/bookshelf` and its descendants, because it is a member
of the set of target relationships defined in the `excludes` property.

The value of `expansionRule` determines the final set of paths that are
considered included members of the collection instance. Interpreting the
semantics of each of the allowed values must be done according to the
following rules:

- `expandPrims`: the set of included paths shall consist of the paths of
  all prims including and descendant to the specified prim path.
- `expandPrimsAndProperties`: the set of included paths shall consist of
  the paths of all prims and all properties within those prims including
  and descendant to the specified prim path.
- `explicitOnly`: the set of included paths shall consist *only* of the
  paths explicitly listed in the `includes` set (and not excluded by the
  `excludes` set).

Consider the following scene description:

``` python
def "foo" {
    def "bar" (
        prepend apiSchemas = "CollectionAPI:bar1"
    )
    {
        rel collection:bar1:includes = [
            </foo/bar/baz>
        ]
        rel collection:bar1:excludes = [
            </foo/bar/baz.foobaz>
        ]

        def "baz" {
            uniform token foobar = "foobar"
            uniform token foobaz = "foobaz"

            def "boo" {
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The evaluated included paths for each of the rules would be as follows:

- `expandPrims`: \[`/foo/bar/baz`, `/foo/bar/baz/boo`\]
- `expandPrimAndPropertyPaths`: \[`/foo/bar/baz`, `/foo/bar/baz.foobar`,
  `/foo/bar/baz/boo`\]
- `explicitOnly`: \[`foo/bar/baz`\]

Relationship targets for `includes` can also include property paths
referring to other collections. In this case, when evaluated, the set of
property paths that would be included in the target collection are also
included in targeting collection (recursively, if the targeted
collection also targeted another collection, etc.)

Expanding on the scene description above:

``` python
def "foo" {
    def "bar" (
        prepend apiSchemas = "CollectionAPI:bar1"
    )
    {
        rel collection:bar1:includes = [
            </foo/bar/baz>,
            </foo/fooboo.collection:fooboo1>
        ]
        rel collection:bar1:excludes = [
            </foo/bar/baz.foobaz>
        ]

        def "baz" {
            uniform token foobar = "foobar"
            uniform token foobaz = "foobaz"

            def "boo" {
            }
        }
    }

    def "fooboo" (
        prepend apiSchemas = "CollectionAPI:fooboo1"
    )
    {
        rel collection:fooboo1:includes = [
            </foo/fooboo/fooboobar>
        ]
        def "fooboobar"{
        }
    }
}
```

Using the `expandPrims` value for the `expansionRule`, the `bar1`
collection instance would include:

    [/foo/bar/baz, /foo/bar/baz/boo, /foo/fooboo/fooboobar]

Note that the set of target relationships in `excludes` should not
contain *orphaned* excluded paths. That is, excluded paths must refer to
a subset of those included in the included paths. If orphaned excluded
paths are present, their presence is treated as inert.

# Core File Formats

This section will outline the three core file formats that are required
to be implemented for USD.

## Compatibility with Document Versions

All readers, regardless of format, must be able to read all previous
versions within the same MAJOR version, unless:

- The specification provides a minimum version of a document to support
- Extenuating security issues are present within a document version

For example, a hypothetical version 1.2.1 compatible parser, must read
all l 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 version documents up to the current supported
version.

It is not required to read documents that have newer MAJOR or MINOR
versions than the current parser, but all future PATCH versions must be
readable.

However, if a particular PATCH version is known to carry a security risk
or other breaking risks, files bearing that version may be rejected by a
later parser. An implementation should consider providing a method to
migrate a file bearing a rejected version to the latest version.

When reading unsupported document versions, it is recommended to surface
an error upon discovering the document version is unsupported. Parsers
must not simply ignore unsupported elements of the grammar as that may
unintentionally change the intention of the document.

## Text

USD represents its scene data in a bespoke text grammar as USDA files.
They may be stored with the `.usda` or `.usd` extension.

### Encoding

While the USDA name originally implied that the files were ASCII, USDA
files today are encoded in the UTF-8 standard, as defined by [ISO/IEC
10646:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/76835.html).

### Grammar Conventions

The Specification will describe the parsing grammar for USDA documents,
which will hereafter be referred to as “the grammar”, or as “the USDA
grammar”. The grammar is specified using PEG notation as defined in
\[\1\].\
The conventions used here are the same as those described in the [path
grammar](#conventions).

### Whitespace Formatting

Simple whitespace denotes basic logical separation rules between two
parts of the document. The USDA document format is not indentation
sensitive and items on independent lines may be indented at different
levels than each other. End of lines in USDA can be either carriage
return (CR), line feed (LF), or a combination of CRLF.

``` peg
Space <- [U+0020] /  
         [U+0009]
```

``` peg
CrLf <- [U+000D] /  
        [U+000A] /  
        [U+000D][U+000A]
```

### Special Characters

Certain characters are used throughout the grammar for purposes such as
denoting e.g, lists, tuples, start and end of blocks, etc. Explicit
rules are made for these characters to make it easier to read where
these characters are used in more complex rule definitions.

    ForwardSlash <- '/'

    Backslash <- '\'

    SingleQuote <- "'"

    DoubleQuote <- '"'

    LeftParen <- '('

    RightParen <- ')'

    LeftBracket <- '['

    RightBracket <- ']'

    LeftCurlyBrace <- '{'

    RightCurlyBrace <- '}'

    LeftAngleBracket <- '<'

    RightAngleBracket <- '>'

    Ampersand <- '&'

    Asterisk <- '*'

    At <- '@'

    Colon <- ':'

    Comma <- ','

    Dot <- '.'

    Equals <- '='

    Minus <- '-'

    Plus <- '+'

    Pound <- '#'

    SemiColon <- ';'

    Underscore <- '_'

### Character and Numeric Literals

Literals represent the basic production rules where literal characters
are given semantic meaning. These are production rules that represent
characters, numbers, and strings. As USDA must be UTF-8 encoded, valid
characters are interpreted as Unicode code points and generally comprise
characters that do not exist in the private-use or non-character code
point ranges.

#### Double-Precision Floating Point Representation when Writing USDA content

The conversion of a double-precision floating point number to its string
representation shall follow these rules:

1.  Special Values

    1.1. If the value is positive infinity, it shall be represented as
    “inf”

    1.2. If the value is negative infinity, it shall be represented as
    “-inf”

    1.3. If the value is Not-a-Number, it shall be represented as “nan”

2.  Finite Values

    2.1. The conversion shall produce the shortest string that correctly
    represents the value such that parsing the string returns the
    original value

    2.2. The representation shall use either decimal or scientific
    notation based on the following criteria:

    1)  Scientific notation shall be used when the decimal exponent is
        less than -6
    2)  Scientific notation shall be used when the decimal exponent is
        greater than or equal to 15
    3)  Decimal notation shall be used otherwise

    2.3. When scientific notation is used:

    1)  It shall consist of one significant digit before the decimal
        point
    2)  It shall use the character ‘e’ or ‘E’ to denote the exponent
    3)  The exponent shall be represented as a signed decimal integer

    2.4. The representation shall not include (even though the grammar
    allows it):

    1)  Trailing decimal points
    2)  Unnecessary trailing zeros in the fractional part
    3)  Positive signs for positive exponents
    4)  Leading zeros in the integer part except when representing
        values less than 1

3.  Examples of Compliant Representations:

    - 0.000001 -\> “0.000001”
    - 0.0000001 -\> “1e-7”
    - 10000000000000000.0 -\> “1e16”
    - 1000.0 -\> “1000”
    - 0.0 -\> “0”

### Comments, Complex Whitespace, and Separators

USDA supports the use of comments, which are human-readable annotations
that do not contribute to scene description.

USDA supports a varying set of comment representations and these
comments contribute to more complex whitespace definitions that are used
in production rules throughout the grammar. Separators are used to
denote separation between logical items in the grammar, whether they be
explicit lists of items (e.g., lists, tuples, etc.) or implicit ones
(e.g., prims, properties, etc.).

``` peg
 CppStyleMultilineOpen <- ForwardSlash Asterisk
```

``` peg
 CppStyleMultlineClose <- Asterisk ForwardSlash
```

``` peg
 PythonStyleComment <- Pound (NonCrlfUtf8Character)*
```

``` peg
 CppStyleSinglelineComment <- ForwardSlash ForwardSlash (NonCrlfUtf8Character)*
```

``` peg
 CppStyleMultilineComment <- CppStyleMultilineOpen ↵
                             (!(Asterisk ForwardSlash) Utf8Character)* ↵
                             CppStyleMultilineClose
```

``` peg
 CppStyleComment <- CppStyleMultilineComment /  
                    CppStyleSinglelineComment
```

``` peg
 Comment <- PythonStyleComment /  
            CppStyleComment  
```

``` peg
 InlinePadding <- Space /  
                  CppStyleMultilineComment
```

``` peg
 SinglelinePadding <- Space /  
                      Comment
```

``` peg
 MultilinePadding <- Space /  
                     Crlf /  
                     Comment
```

``` peg
 ListSeparator <- Comma
```

``` peg
 StatementSeparator <- Crlf /  
                       Semicolon
```

### Keywords

Keywords are specific sequences of literals reserved by USDA with
specific semantic meaning.

> *Note:* In almost all cases, a keyword is identified specifically in
> the production rule it is a part of. The keywords are listed here
> specifically to identify them as reserved words for the
> *KeywordlessIdentifier* production in cases where it is required to
> separate semantic meaning between any *BaseIdentifier* and an
> *Identifier* that is not a *Keyword*.

    Keyword <- 'append' /  
               'bezier' /  
               'class' /  
               'connect' /  
               'curve' /  
               'custom' /  
               'customData' /
               'def' /  
               'delete' /  
               'dictionary' /  
               'doc' /  
               'held' /  
               'hermite' /  
               'inherits' /  
               'kind' /  
               'linear' /  
               'loop' /  
               'nameChildren' /  
               'None' /  
               'none' /  
               'offset' /  
               'oscillate' /  
               'over' /  
               'payload' /  
               'post' /  
               'pre' /  
               'prepend' /  
               'properties' /  
               'references' /  
               'relocates' /  
               'rel' /  
               'reorder' /  
               'repeat' /  
               'reset' /  
               'rootPrims' /  
               'scale' /  
               'sloped' /  
               'subLayers' /  
               'specializes' /  
               'spline' /  
               'timeSamples' /  
               'uniform' /  
               'variantSet' /  
               'variantSets' /  
               'variants' /  
               'varying'

### Identifiers

USD layers consist of several semantic rules that contain *identifiers*.

``` peg
XidStart <- [XID_Start] /  
            Underscore
```

``` peg
XidContinue <- [XID_Continue]
```

``` peg

AsciiStart <- [A-Za-z_]
```

``` peg
AsciiContinue <- [A-Za-z0-9_]
```

``` peg
BaseIdentifier <- XidStart (XidContinue)*
```

``` peg
KeywordlessIdentifier <- !(Keyword) BaseIdentifier
```

``` peg
Identifier <- KeywordlessIdentifier
```

``` peg
NamespacedName <- BaseIdentifier (Colon BaseIdentifier)*
```

### Paths and Asset References

Paths are used in several places in the grammar to define references to
prims or properties within a scene. The productions for Path reference
the **Path** production [here](#path-grammar). This ensures
interpretation of paths is consistent when parsing both paths and
layers. Assets can also be referenced from a layer and scales or offsets
within those assets can be used when bringing in content from another
layer.

``` peg
PathRef <- LeftAngleBracket Path? RightAngleBracket
```

``` peg
AssetRefCharacter <- !(At) NonCrlfUtf8Character
```

``` peg
AssetRef <- At At At (!(At At At)(NonCrlfUtf8Character)*) ↵
                     (!(At At At)(At At))? At At At /  
            At (AssetRefCharacter)* At
```

``` peg
LayerOffset <- 'offset' Assignment Number /  
               'scale' Assignment Number
```

Examples of asset path declarations are given below:

| Declaration | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `@texture.png@` | References an external file path called texture.png |
| `@car.usdz[0/texture.png]@` | References an asset path at 0/texture.png within the car.usdz |
| `@car.usdz@</models/window>` | References a prim at the path /models/window within the car.usdz file |
| `</models/window>` | References a prim at the path /models/window within the current USD stage |

### Lists and Statement Contents

Though not strictly PEG grammar rules, this section highlights a generic
production that makes it easier to read complex productions that contain
lists or sequences of statements. The generic is denoted with the letter
`T` which can be replaced with a real production when seen in the
grammar.

``` peg
List<T> <- T ((InlinePadding)* ListSeparator (MultlinePadding)* T)* ↵ 
              (InlinePadding)* (ListSeparator (MultilinePadding)*)?
```

``` peg
Sequence<T> <- T ((SinglelinePadding)* StatementSeparator (MultilinePadding)* T)* ↵
                  (SinglinePadding)* (StatementSeparator (MultilinePadding)*)? 
```

### Values

Values are data stored in fields at a particular location (e.g.,
attribute, reference, etc.). These are typically found on the right hand
side of assignment statements and represent simple values (such as
numbers, identifiers, strings, and asset references) and complex values
(such as tuples, lists, dictionaries, etc.). Typically, complex values
store sets of values that could be simple, complex, or heterogeneous. In
certain cases, specific productions are called out for e.g.,
dictionaries that can only have key / value pairs represented as
strings, etc.

``` peg
AtomicValue <- Number /  
               Identifier /  
               String /  
               AssetRef
```

``` peg
TupleItem <- AtomicValue /  
             TupleValue
```

``` peg
TupleValue <- LeftParen (MultilinePadding)* List<TupleItem> (MulitlinePadding)* RightParen
```

``` peg
ListItem <- AtomicValue /  
            ListValue /  
            TupleValue
```

``` peg
ListValue <- LeftBracket (MultilinePadding)* List<ListItem> ↵ 
             (MultilinePadding)* RightBracket
```

``` peg
ArrayType <- LeftBracket (InlinePadding)* RightBracket
```

``` peg
TypedValue <- AtomicValue /  
              TupleValue /  
              ArrayType /  
              ListValue /  
              PathRef
```

``` peg
Assignment <- (InlinePadding)* Equals (InlinePadding)*
```

``` peg
DictionaryKey <- String /  
                 BaseIdentifier  
```

``` peg
DictionaryType <- Identifier ((InlinePadding)* ArrayType)?
```

``` peg
DictionaryValueItem <- 'dictionary' (InlinePadding)+ DictionaryKey Assignment DictionaryValue /  
                     DictionaryType (InlinePadding)+ DictionaryKey Assignment TypedValue
```

``` peg
DictionaryValue <- LeftCurlyBrace (MultilinePadding)* ↵
                   (Sequence<DictionaryValueItem> (MultilinePadding)*)? RightCurlyBrace
```

``` peg
StringDictionaryItem <- String (InlinePadding)* Colon (InlinePadding)* String
```

``` peg
StringDictionary <- LeftCurlyBrace (MultilinePadding)* ↵
                    (List<StringDictionaryItem> (MultilinePadding)*)? RightCurlyBrace
```

``` peg
NameList <- String /  
            LeftBracket (MultilinePadding)* List<String> (MultilinePadding)? RightBracket
```

> *Note:* While the grammar itself makes no statement about the type of
> values in lists and tuples, in practice these values should be
> homogenous in type for downstream use.

### Time Samples

Time samples are used to describe a key-value mapping that maps time
code ordinates to values such that values of an attribute can change
over time.

``` peg
TimeSample <- Number (InlinePadding)* Colon (InlinePadding)*  
              ('None' / TypedValue)
```

``` peg
TimeSampleMap <- LeftCurlyBrace (MultilinePadding)* ↵
                 (List<TimeSample> (MultilinePadding)*)? RightCurlyBrace
```

### Splines

Splines are used to define spline curves as a first class data type.

``` peg
SplineCurveTypeItem <- 'bezier' /  
                       'hermite'
```

``` peg
SplineExtrapolationItem <- 'pre' (InlinePadding)* Colon (InlinePadding)* SplineExtrapolation /  
                           'post' (InlinePadding)* Colon (InlinePadding)* SplineExtrapolation
```

``` peg
LoopOption <- 'repeat' /  
              'reset' /  
              'oscillate'
```

``` peg
SplineExtrapolation <- 'none' /  
                       'held' /  
                       'linear' /  
                       'sloped' (InlinePadding)+ LeftParen (InlinePadding)* ↵
                       Number (InlinePadding)* RightParen /  
                       'loop' (InlinePadding)+ LoopOption  
```

``` peg
SplineLoopItem <- 'loop' (InlinePadding)* Colon (InlinePadding)* ↵
                  LeftParen (InlinePadding)* ↵
                  Number (InlinePadding)* Comma (InlinePadding)* ↵
                  Number (InlinePadding)* Comma (InlinePadding)* ↵
                  Number (InlinePadding)* Comma (InlinePadding)* ↵
                  Number (InlinePadding)* Comma (InlinePadding)* ↵
                  Number (InlinePadding)* RightParen
```

``` peg
SplineKnotItem <- Number (InlinePadding)* Colon (InlinePadding)* ↵
                  SplineKnotValues (InlinePadding)* (SplineKnotParameters)*
```

``` peg
SplineKnotValues <- Number (InlinePadding)* Ampersand (InlinePadding)* Number /  
                    Number
```

``` peg
SplineKnotParameters <- Semicolon (InlinePadding)* SplineKnotParameterList
```

``` peg
SplineKnotParameterList <- SplineKnotParameter 
                           ((InlinePadding)* Semicolon (InlinePadding)* ↵
                           SplineKnotParameter)*
```

``` peg
SplineKnotParameter <- 'pre' (InlinePadding)+ SplineTangent /  
                       'post' (InlinePadding)+ SplineInterpMode ↵
                       ((InlinePadding)+ SplineTangent)? /  
                       DictionaryValue
```

``` peg
SplineInterpMode <- 'none' /  
                    'held' /  
                    'linear' /  
                    'curve'
```

``` peg
SplineTangent <- LeftParen (InlinePadding)* SplineTangentContent (InlinePadding)* RightParen
```

``` peg
SplineTangentContent <- Number (InlinePadding)* Comma (InlinePadding)* Number /  
                        Number 
```

``` peg
SplineItem <- SplineCurveTypeItem /  
              SplineExtrapolationItem /  
              SplineLoopItem /  
              SplineKnotItem
```

``` peg
SplineMap <- LeftCurlyBrace (MultilinePadding)* ↵ 
             (List<SplineItem> (MultilinePadding)*)? RightCurlyBrace
```

### A General Note on Listops

A listop value for a spec’s metadata field contains four separate lists:

- `explicit` values
- `append` values
- `prepend` values
- `delete` values

If a listop type is not specified when encountering productions
containing list op values, those values are implicitly assigned to the
`explicit` list of the list op. If a list op type is not explicitly
specified, it’s value is `[]`. Furthermore, unless otherwise specified,
values encountered for the same metadata field for the same list op are
interpreted as “last one wins”.

Consider the following scenario:

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
  foo = [6, 5, 4]
  append foo = [3, 2, 1]
  append foo = [1, 2, 3]
)
```

In this case, the metadata field `foo` will have a listop assigned where
each of the list op types have the following values:

- `explicit`: \[6, 5, 4\]
- `append`: \[1, 2, 3\]
- `prepend`: \[\]
- `delete`: \[\]

Empty list ops do not have to be assigned as the empty list is their
default value. Except in the case of [attributes](#attribute-values), a
value of `None` is equivalent to `[]`.

A list op without an assignment may be treated as a no-op. For example:

``` python
#usda 1.0
(
  append rel myRel
)
```

Although a legal statement with regard to the grammar, no semantic
meaning is assigned to this statement.

### Common Metadata

Metadata can be attached to layers, prims, attributes, and
relationships. Although the allowed metadata varies between them, there
are some metadata definitions that are shared amongst them. These
productions are captured in this section. Additional metadata items that
are specific to a particular spec are defined in that specific section.

``` peg
MetadataValue <- 'None' /  
                 DictionaryValue /  
                 TypedValue  
```

``` peg
KeyValueMetadata <- Identifier Assignment MetadataValue
```

``` peg
DocMetadata <- 'doc' Assignment String
```

``` peg
ListOp <- 'delete' /  
          'append' /  
          'prepend'
```

``` peg
ListOpValue <- 'None' /  
              ListValue
```

``` peg
ListOpMetadata <- ListOp (InlinePadding)+ Identifier Assignment ListOpValue
```

``` peg
SharedMetadata <- String /  
                  KeyValueMetadata /  
                  DocMetadata
```

> *Note:* In cases where list ops are used in metadata, often there is a
> choice between a list op and a single item. The use of a single item
> in place of an explicit list op is always considered to be implicitly
> declared as an explicit list op.

In addition, since metadata appears in multiple spec declarations, a
templated rule is used to make reading those production rules easier:

``` peg
MetadataBlock<T> <- LeftParen (MultilinePadding)* (Sequence<T> (MultlinePadding)*)? RightParen
```

### Attribute Specs

*Attributes* are properties within a prim meant for authoring and
retrieving numeric, string, and array valued data, sampled over time.

> *Note:* Although *AttributeType* is represented by an *Identifier* in
> production rules, an extra layer of validation is done on these types
> to ensure the *Identifier* reduction results in a valid
> [type](#foundational-data-types). The behavior is undefined if the
> type is unresolvable.

> *Note:* If an *AttributeVariability* is not explicitly specified, the
> attribute will default to *varying*.

``` peg
AttributeMetadataItem <- SharedMetadata  /
                         ListOpMetadata
```

    AttributeMetadata <- MetadataBlock<AttributeMetadataItem>  

``` peg
AttributeVariability <- 'uniform'
```

``` peg
AttributeType <- (AttributeVariability (InlinePadding)+)? Identifier ((InlinePadding)* ArrayType)?
```

``` peg
AttributeDeclaration <- ('custom' (InlinePadding)+)? AttributeType (InlinePadding)+ NamespacedName
```

``` peg
AttributeAssignment <- Assignment 'None' /  
                       Assignment TypedValue
```

``` peg
ConnectValue <- 'None' /  
                PathRef /  
                LeftBracket (MultilinePadding)* (List<PathRef> (MultlinePadding)*)? RightBracket
```

``` peg
SpecialAttributeType <- 'timeSamples' Assignment TimeSampleMap /  
                        'connect' Assignment ConnectValue /  
                        'spline' Assignment SplineMap
```

``` peg
ListOpConnect <- ListOp (InlinePadding)+ AttributeDeclaration ↵
                 (InlinePadding)* Dot (InlinePadding)*  ↵
                 'connect' Assignment ConnectValue
```

``` peg
AttributeSpec <- AttributeDeclaration ↵
                 (AttributeAssignment)? (InlinePadding)* ↵
                 (AttributeMetadata (InlinePadding)*)? /  
                 AttributeDeclaration ↵
                 (InlinePadding)* Dot (InlinePadding)* SpecialAttributeType /  
                 ListOpConnect
```

> *Note:* Connect attribute list op syntax shares the start of the
> production (the list op) with other productions at the same level
> (e.g., list op relationships). In order to keep the grammar readable,
> these productions are formed as distinct from each other, but

#### Attribute Declarations

The `AttributeDeclaration` production contains all the information
necessary to form the new attribute spec. The items within the
declaration are mapped to the following metadata fields on that
attribute spec:

- The required metadata field `custom` shall be authored to `true` if
  the `custom` keyword was part of the declaration, and authored to
  `false` otherwise.
- The required metadata field `variability` shall be authored to
  `uniform` if the keyword is present, and authored to `varying`
  otherwise.
- The attribute type (it’s identifier and array type declaration) is
  assigned to the `typeName` field.
- The name of the identifier is used to form the path that identifies
  the new attribute spec.\
  The path for an attribute is constructed by taking the path
  identifying the parent spec (i.e. the spec for which this attribute
  will be one of the `propertyChildren`) and joining it with the parsed
  namespaced name by means of a `.` character.

For example:

``` python
def "foo" {
  int bar                       // a new attribute spec with path `/foo.bar`, 
                                // `typeName` = `int`, 
                                // and default variability
  uniform float3d baz:foobar    // a new attribute spec with path `/foo.baz:foobar`,
                                // `typeName` = `float3d` 
                                // and `variability` = `uniform`
}
```

#### Attribute Values

The value of an attribute assignment that isn’t associated with a set of
time samples, connections, or splines shall be assigned to the `default`
metadata field. This value is by default unblocked. If an attribute spec
is assigned a value of `None`, this indicates that the attribute shall
be blocked, thus excluding weaker opinions. The file format is only
responsible for setting the metadata field to the value block sentinel
in this case; the process of value resolution is responsible for
resolving the final value taking the block into consideration. That is:

``` python
int x = 7     # Value resolves to 7, implicitly blocks any authored weaker opinions and fallback
int x         # Value resolves to authored weaker opinions or fallback if not authored
int x = None  # Skip authored weaker opinions and only resolve to fallback
```

Note that it is not the parser’s responsibility to resolve the final
value, only to set the metadata fields appropriately such that it can be
resolved correctly downstream.

#### TimeSamples

Attribute values that are assigned as part of a time sample map are
assigned to the `timeSamples` metadata field. An attribute can have both
an assigned value for the `default` metadata field as well as a value
assigned for the `timeSamples` metadata field. Time sample values inside
the parsed time sample map are not required to be stored in any explicit
order. Individual time samples can have their value blocked if assigned
a value of `None`, which has the same semantics as when blocking the
default attribute value.

#### Connections

The value of an attribute may also be a set of connections to other
prims or properties. These connections are represented by a set of
paths, and values parsed from the `ConnectValue` attribute shall be
assigned to the `connectionPaths` metadata field of the attribute spec.
Note that this value is a listop, and so can contain any number of paths
explicitly set, appended, prepended, or deleted. If no list op was
parsed as part of parsing the connect attribute, the list op is assumed
to be `explicit`.

#### Splines

An attribute value may also be associated with a spline. The data for a
spline value are built up from each individual spline item contained
within the assigned spline map. These can be of the following types:

*Curve Type*

This string denotes the type of the spline, either `hermite` or `bezier`

*Extrapolation*

An extrapolation item may either indicate a `pre` extrapolation or a
`post` extrapolation. The extrapolation type can be one of:

- `none`
- `held`
- `linear`
- `sloped`
- `loop`

If the value is `sloped` there is an additional value that indicates the
value of the slope. If the value is `loop`, there is an additional value
that indicates whether the loop extrapolation should be `repeat`,
`reset`, or `oscillate`.

*Loop*

A loop item consists of five values mapped to spline data in the
following order:

- `prototype start`
- `prototype end`
- `number of pre loop intervals`
- `number of post loop intervals`
- `value offset`

*Knots*

A spline may have any number of knots specified, where each knot is
associated with a time and a value (and an optional pre-value). If two
values are specified (separated by an `&`) for the knot value, the first
indicates the pre-value and the second the value. A knot may also have a
set of parameters that can indicate:

- A knot’s `pre-tangent`
- A knot’s `post-tangent`
- A dictionary of custom data to associate with the knot.

The `pre-tangent` and `post-tangent` values indicate either a single
value or a set of two values. If single-valued, this is the value of the
slope of the tangent. If dual-valued, the values describe the slope of
the tangent and the width of the tangent. A `post-tangent` may also have
an associated spline interpolation mode, which can be one of the
following:

- `none`
- `held`
- `linear`
- `curve`

For any of the above values, it is possible from the grammar to see two
spline items that describe the same thing. For example:

``` python
def "foo" {
  float mySpline.spline = {
    bezier,
    hermite
  }
}
```

In the above example, a `curve type` item is parsed twice for the same
spline, with the first item indicating the spline is `bezier` and the
second item indicating the spline is `hermite`. In all cases where
multiple values for the same item type are parsed, the last one the
parser encounters is the one for which the values of the spline are
stored. In the case of `knots`, a spline may have multiple knots, but
within the same knot duplicate information may be specified. In these
cases, the last value wins. Consider the following:

``` python
def "foo" {
  float mySpline.spline = {
    6: 6532.62342; post curve (3.6, -7.8); post none,
  }
}
```

In the above example, the knot at time `6` has two items defining it’s
`post-tangent` value. In this case, the knot will be assigned a
`post-tangent` value of `none` with no associated slope.

#### Attribute Types and Value Validation

Attribute types are represented as identifiers (with an optional \[\]
indicating whether it’s an array or not).\
The parser must ensure that if a type is resolvable (i.e., it is a known
type specified in [Foundational Data Types](#foundational-data-types)),
that the value specified for the attribute is consistent with its
declared type.\
If the inferred value parsed is not consistent with the declared type,
an attempt may be made to coerce the value to be consistent with the
declared type. Values that are inconsistent with the declared type, and
that cannot be coerced to the type, must result in an error. If a type
is unresolvable, the behavior for value validation is undefined.

A few examples:

``` python
def "foo" {
  int bar = 3                                   // ok - value consistent with the declared type
  int[] baz = 3                                 // error - scalar value for attribute declared 
                                                // as vectorized type
  float foobar = 4                              // ok - parsed value can be coerced to be consistent 
                                                // with declared type (e.g., 4.0)
  point3d[] points = [(-120.5, 181.73, 112.3)]  // ok - value consistent with the underlying 
                                                // type `double3` of the semantic alias `point3d`
  double4 zero = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)                // error - ill-dimensioned tuple value
  matrix4d transform = [
    (0.9, 0, 0, 0),
    (0, 0.9, 0, 0),
    (0, 0, 0.9, 0),
    (0, 0, 0, 1)
  ]                                        // error - value is array-valued rather than tuple-valued                           
  myType foobaz = "some value"             // undefined - myType unresolvable
}
```

#### Relationship Specs

A *relationship* is a property that creates a dependency between scene
graph objects by allowing a prim to target other prims, attributes, or
relationships.

``` peg
RelationshipMetadataItem <- SharedMetadata /  
                            ListOpMetadata
```

    RelationshipMetadata <- MetadataBlock<RelationshipMetadataItem>

``` peg
RelationshipType <- 'rel' /  
                    'custom' (InlinePadding)+ 'rel'
```

``` peg
RelationshipAssignment <- Assignment 'None' /  
                          Assignment PathRef /  
                          Assignment LeftBracket (MultilinePadding)* ↵
                          (List<PathRef> (MultilinePadding)*)? RightBracket
```

``` peg
ListOpRelationship <- ListOp (InlinePadding)+ RelationshipType (InlinePadding)+ ↵
                      NamespacedName (RelationshipAssignment)?
```

``` peg
RelationshipSpec <- RelationshipType (InlinePadding)+ NamespacedName ↵
                    (RelationshipAssignment)? (InlinePadding)* (RelationshipMetadata)? /  
                    RelationshipType (InlinePadding)+ NamespacedName ↵
                    (InlinePadding)? LeftBracket ↵
                       (InlinePadding)* PathRef (InlinePadding)* ↵ 
                    RightBracket / 
                    RelationshipType (InlinePadding)+ NamespacedName ↵
                    (InlinePadding)* Dot (InlinePadding)* TimeSampleOrDefault /  
                    ListOpRelationship
```

#### Relationship Types

The information parsed from the `RelationshipType` and `NamespacedName`
productions are enough information to form a new relationship spec. The
path associated with this new relationship spec is formed by combining
the path of the parent spec (i.e., the spec where this relationship spec
will be set in `propertyChildren`) with the name of the relationship via
a `.` character. If the `custom` keyword was parsed in the type
declaration, the boolean value of `true` shall be assigned to the
`custom` metadata field.

#### Relationship Values

The values assigned in a relationship declaration indicate target paths
of the relationship. These are listop values and shall be assigned to
the `targetPaths` metadata field. If a listop is not specified, the set
of values must be assigned to the `explicit` list op. If a single value
is parsed (e.g., `rel foo = </bar>`), the value shall be translated as
if it were a list of one value.

Target paths may not contain variant selections. It is at the discretion
of the text parser to either emit a parse error if a path with one or
more variant selections is present or to strip the variant selection
from the path prior to setting the `targetPaths` metadata field value.

### Prim Specs

A *prim* is a container object represented by a unique path within the
namespace hierarchy of a layer that contains a set of properties (i.e.,
attributes and relationships). Prims also serve as the site of
composition arcs, and as such can define references, payloads, and other
composition arcs as part of its definition.

```

#### Prim Declaration Components

The value parsed for the prim specifier (e.g. `def`, `over`, or `class`)
shall be placed in the `specifier` metadata field of the document data
model.

The value parsed for the prim type name shall be placed in the
`typeName` metadata field of the document data model. If no type name is
present, this value shall not be assigned.

The value parsed for the prim identifier (i.e., the `String` production
denoting the name of the prim spec) shall be appended to the path of the
prim spec’s parent to form the uniquely addressable path for the prim
spec.

For example, parsing the definition for the following prim specs:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def Foo "bar" {
  over "Baz" {
  }
}
```

shall result in creation of a new prim spec with uniquely addressable
path `/bar` with the following metadata fields assigned:

- `specifier`: `def`
- `typeName`: `Foo`

and a new prim spec with uniquely addressable path `/bar/Baz` with the
following metadata fields assigned:

- `specifier`: `over`

#### Prim Spec Children

A prim spec can contain three different kinds of children:

- Prim specs
- Property specs
- VariantSet specs

Each of these categories of items are assigned to different metadata
fields of the prim spec in the data model:

- `primChildren` (the list of names of the prim specs contained within
  this prim spec)
- `propertyChildren` (the list of names of the property specs contained
  within this prim spec)
- `variantSetChildren` (the list of names of the variantSet specs
  contained within this prim spec)

Note that in each case, the names assigned to the list are the simple
names of the spec rather than the full path of the spec. For examples,
consider the following case:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "foo" {
  int bar = 4
  over "baz" {
  }

  variantSet "variant" = {
    "x" {
      def "variantFoo" {
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This would result in the following set of named specs with metadata
fields (only relevant fields shown):

- `/foo` (prim spec)
  - `primChildren`: \[`baz`\]
  - `propertyChildren`: \[`bar`\]
  - `variantSetChildren`: \[`variant`\]
- `/foo.bar` (attribute spec)
- `/foo/baz` (prim spec)
- `/foo{variant}` (variantSet spec)

##### `specifier` and `typeName` for Variants

Variant specs have the same set of allowed and required metadata fields
as prim specs. The document model states that `typeName` may be authored
and `specifier` is required to be authored for variants. The `usda`
format does not currently provide for the storage of either field and
should always report `typeName` as unauthored and `specifier` as being
authored with value `over` until a future revision can specify explicit
storage.

#### Child Ordering

Prim specs have a notion of ordering of their prim spec children and
property spec children for traversal operations. If no explicit ordering
is provided, traversal occurs via the `primChildren` and
`propertyChildren` metadata fields. If ordering is explicitly specified
(via `reorder nameChildren` for prim specs and
`reorder propertyChildren` for property specs), the list of names
specified are added to the `primOrder` and `propertyOrder` metadata
fields in the data model of the prim spec being parsed. These lists may
be sparse (i.e., contain only a few names as opposed to all children)
and if encountered multiple times when parsing a prim spec will
overwrite the previous value.

Consider the following example:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "foo" {
  int bar = 4
  over "baz" {
  }
  def "foobar" {
  }
  string foobaz = "value"
  float barbaz = 3.7

  reorder nameChildren = ["foobar"]
  reorder propertyChildren = ["barbaz"]
}
```

This would result in the following children relevant metadata fields for
the spec `/foo`:

- `primChildren`: \[`baz`, `foobar`\]
- `propertyChildren`: \[`bar`, `foobaz`, `barbaz`\]
- `primOrder`: \[`foobar`\]
- `propertyOrder`: \[`barbaz`\]

implying that when traversing the prim children of `/foo`, `/foo/foobar`
should be traversed before `/foo/baz` and that when traversing the
property children of `/foo`, `/foo.barbaz` should be traversed before
`/foo.bar` and `/foo.foobaz`.

#### Prim Metadata

Prim metadata comprises the largest group of metadata of all the specs.
The majority of these metadata productions are aimed at providing
opinions for the composition system. Each of these items is mapped to
metadata fields as follows:

- Payload Metadata - values are assigned to the `payload` metadata field
- References Metadata - values are assigned to the `references` metadata
  field
- Inherits Metadata - values are assigned to the `inheritPaths` metadata
  field
- Specializes Metadata - values are assigned to the `specializes`
  metadata field
- VariantSets Metadata - values are assigned to the `variantSetNames`
  metadata field
- Variants Metadata - values are assigned to the `variantSelection`
  metadata field
- Kind Metadata - value is assigned to the `kind` metadata field

Several well-known metadata fields for prim specs (e.g., `active`,
`instanceable`, `displayName`, etc.) do not have concretely specified
parser production rules and instead are set via the generic key / value
data of `KeyValueMetadata`.

Note that all metadata fields can be seen more than once - in these
cases the last value is that which is ultimately assigned to the prim
spec metadata field. Also note that seeing a particular metadata
production in listop form and non-listop form is different from seeing
the metadata production in e.g., the same listop form or non-listop form
multiple times. For example:

``` python
def "foo" (
  payload = </bar>
  prepend payload = </baz>
){
}

def "foobar" (
  payload = </bar>
  prepend payload = </baz>
  prepend payload = </foo>
){
}
```

Here, the prim spec `/foo` has two distinct items of `payload` metadata,
an `explicit` listop and a `prepend` listop. `/foobar` on the other hand
has a duplicate metadata item (i.e., two `prepend` listops).\
In this case, the list for the `prepend` list op stored on the `payload`
metadata field for `/foobar` should be `[/foo]`.

#### Reference vs Payload Parameters

Note that the production rules for reference and payload parameters both
contain information about the layer offset ( e.g., `offset` and
`scale`). The final layer offset is built up by parsing each item and
replacing the value for either `offset` or `scale` in the final
structure instance. However, reference parameters can have an additional
value mixed in - `customData`. Implementations shall parse this value
out, but there is no element of the structure capturing a reference nor
a specific metadata field in the prim spec that captures this data and
hence the value can be discarded.

### Layer

The *layer* serves as the representation of the document data model and
can be persisted in different formats. This part of the specification
describes a text scene description format with the suffix ***.usda***.

``` peg
SublayerItem <- AssetRef (InlinePadding)* ↵ 
                (LeftParen (MultlinePadding)* ↵ 
                (Sequence<LayerOffset> (MultilinePadding)*)? 
                RightParen)?  
```

``` peg
SublayerMetadata <- 'subLayers' Assignment LeftBracket (MultilinePadding)* ↵
                    (List<SublayerItem> (MultilinePadding)*)? RightBracket
```

``` peg
RelocatesItem <- PathRef (InlinePadding)* Colon (InlinePadding)* PathRef  
```

``` peg
RelocatesMetadata <- 'relocates' Assignment LeftCurlyBrace (MultilinePadding)* ↵
                     (List<RelocatesItem> (MultilinePadding)*)? RightCurlyBrace
```

    LayerMetadataItem <- SharedMetadata /
                         ListOpMetadata /
                         SublayerMetadata /
                         RelocatesMetadata

    LayerMetadata <- MetadataBlock<LayerMetadataItem>

``` peg
LayerHeader <- Pound 'usda' (InlinePadding)* (Digit)+ Dot (Digit)+ (Dot (Digit)+)?
```

``` peg
LayerItem <- 'reorder' (InlinePadding)+ 'rootPrims' Assignment NameList / PrimSpec
```

``` peg
LayerSpec <- LayerHeader (MultilinePadding)* (LayerMetadata (MultilinePadding)*)? ↵
             (LayerItem (MultilinePadding)*)*
```

> *Note:* This section describes the 1.0 version of the USDA document
> model. Any files based on this specification shall have a layer header
> of the form `#usda 1.0`

#### Layer Header

The `Digit` elements of the `LayerHeader` production correspond, in
order to:

- The MAJOR version of the format
- The MINOR version of the format
- The (optional) PATCH version of the format

There is no data model mapping for the layer header. Validation is done
within the parser itself and can be discarded.

#### Layer Content

Each spec contained within a layer is uniquely addressable via its path.
If at any point a spec definition is encountered with a path that has
been previously encountered, an error must be emitted and all processing
shall cease. For example:

``` python
#usda 1.0

def "foo" {
}

def "bar" {
}

over "foo" {
}
```

In the above case, the spec at path `\foo` is encountered a second time
(with a different specifier). As such, the layer is invalid and no
further processing takes place.

#### Sublayer Metadata

Sublayer metadata maps to the following document data model metadata
fields:

- subLayers (the asset refs)
- subLayerOffsets (the layer offsets)

These fields must be of the same length. If no layer offset is specified
for a sublayer item (asset ref), it’s corresponding entry in the
subLayerOffsets list must receive a default instance of the
subLayerOffsets structure.

Although it is syntactically allowed to specify e.g. multiple scale
fields for a layer offset associated with an asset ref, the last value
specified shall be the value used in the subLayerOffsets structure. For
example, consider the following content:

``` python
subLayers = [
  @myAsset@ (
    scale = 2.3
    offset = 3.0
    scale = 4.1
  )
]
```

Scale is specified twice in this definition, but the final
subLayerOffsets structure that should be written must have an offset of
`3.0` and scale of `4.1`.

#### Root Prim Reordering

A layer item can be either a prim spec or a reorder rootPrims statement.
A reorder rootPrims statement maps to the `primOrder` metadata field.
Similarly to subLayerOffsets, syntactically it is possible to have
multiple reorder rootPrims statements, each of which could have the full
list of root prims in the layer or some sparse subset. These lists shall
not be combined - the last value specified shall be the value used. For
example:

``` python
reorder rootPrims = ["baz"]

def "foo" {
}

def "bar" {
}

def "baz" {
}

reorder rootPrims = ["bar", "baz"]
```

shall result in the `primOrder` field containing `bar` and `baz` in that
order.

#### Layer Relocates Metadata

A prim path can be relocated (i.e. renamed or reparented) in the scope
of the local layer namespace. The source of the composition arc remains
the same (that is, the prim spec to which the source path refers is
still used as normal in composition), but may be referred to in the
local layer namespace by a new name or with a new parent. Each relocate
item is defined by a source prim path and target prim path, and a list
of these are stored in the `layerRelocates` field of the layer spec. For
example, assume there is a prim `baz` in a layer:

``` python
def "foo" {
  def "bar" {
    def "baz" {
    }
  }
}
```

and that the layer is referenced into another layer:

``` python
def "layerdefaultprim" (
  references = @barlayer.usda@</foo>
)
{
}
```

A relocates mapping can be provided such that in the second layer, we
can rename `baz` to `barbaz` and reparent it to `layerdefaultprim` then
create an `over` for that prim:

``` python
#usda 1.0

(
  relocates = {
    </layerdefaultprim/bar/baz> : </layerdefaultprim/barbaz>
  }
)

def "layerdefaultprim" (
  references = @barlayer.usda@</foo>
)
{
  over "barbaz" {
    int bazattribute = 5
  }
} 
```

Note that the parser must not attempt to validate whether a pair of
relocate paths are valid or not as it does not have all the information
to do so - this must be done as part of composition.

### Compatibility with Legacy Content

The grammar defined above represents the normative specification for the
USDA grammar. However, as the OpenUSD ecosystem has evolved over the
years, legacy content predating this specification exists. To provide
maximum compatibility with this content, implementations have the option
of supporting additional production rules for the USDA grammar. The
semantics of these rules are left unspecified; the additional production
rules represent only a means to successfully parse legacy content for
compatibility. Many of the production rules described in this section
are additional rules while some rules are modified from the normative
rules.

### Suggested Simplifications To the Grammar

- Making tuples and arrays homogeneous both improves the performance of
  the grammar and should make the grammar simpler to express
- Make statement separators consistent (always new lines or always new
  lines or `;`)
- Deprecate C++ style comments in favor of Python style comments
- Deprecate CXXNamespacedIdentifiers for typenames
- Minimize metadata statements that require context to parse
  (i.e. customData is just a dictionary, kind is just a token,
  substitutions are just dictionaries)

## Binary

USD uses the Crate format to encode its data in a binary format. They
are typically represented with the `.usdc` or `.usd` extension.

### Order of Reads

The Crate format is designed for minimal parsing on file load. To
achieve this, the general structure of the file is set up in the
preamble section below that must be read first. Value types are parsed
on demand from there on out.

### Endianness

Crate numbers are stored with the least significant bit first to allow
for faster loading on Little Endian systems

### Alignment

It is strongly recommended that uncompressed arrays be aligned to 8-byte
boundaries, as this allows for more efficient reader implementations.

### Floating Point

Floating point data in Crate documents use the IEEE-754 specification
<https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/754/6210/>

### Index

Many fields reference into another section to get their value. USD uses
unsigned 32-bit integers as an index unless otherwise specified.

If a section below uses the title case Index or Indices , it implicitly
refers to this form of Index.

### Check sizes and file offsets

Most binary sections as described below will specify a size prior to
reading the value, or an offset within the file to read.

It is recommended that implementations verify that the combination of
size and offset does not result in a file read beyond the end of the
file.

### Compression

#### LZ4 Compression

Various sections and data blocks use LZ4 compression. LZ4 compression is
described by the LZ4 library at <https://lz4.org/> and is not expanded
here, unless specifics must be provided.

LZ4 compressed data buffers will store the number of chunks as their
first element, as an unsigned 64-bit integer.

If the number of chunks is 0, then the buffer is decompressed as a
whole.

If the number of chunks is specified as higher than zero, the first byte
of each chunk is an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the size of the
chunk in bytes. This is followed by the actual chunk data itself.

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Number of Chunks | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Chunk Size . Only exists if number of chunks \> 0 | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Chunk Data | Defined by Chunk Size if number of chunks is more than 0, or the rest of the buffer if there are 0 chunks. |  |

#### Compressed Integer Arrays

Compressed Integer Arrays are used commonly throughout the Crate
format.\
They can represent either 32-bit or 64-bit integers as required by their
point of use.

They encode integers into a compressed array that is further compressed
using LZ4.

The integer compression algorithm encodes the array as a variable width
series of integers that represent a delta from the previous value.

The array is prefixed by a series of 2 bit codepoints that represent the
width of the specific entry in the list.

##### Conversion to differences

An array of integers is represented as their difference from the
preceding value.

Taking this example array\
`[123, 124, 125, 100125, 100125, 100126, 100126]`

It is converted to\
`[123, 1, 1, 100000, 0, 1, 0]`

##### Encoding Values

The array of differences is described with a single starting integer,
and a series of 2 bit code points that describe the width of each
encoded integer in the array. Following these code points, are the
values associated with them.

The first integer is the most common value in the array. For the example
array, this is 1.\
This value is stored as a signed version of the integer type in use for
the array.

Each value in the array of differences is then converted to a code point
and a value relative to the previous value. The value should use the
smallest width integer type that can represent the value.

If no previous value exists, it starts at 0.

The values are encoded according to this table

| Codepoint | Meaning | Value Encoding |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 00 | Use the Common Value | Discard the value |
| 01 | Quarter width signed integer. | Int8 for 32-bit values Int16 for 64-bit values |
| 10 | Half width signed integer | Int16 for 32-bit values Int32 for 64-bit values |
| 11 | Full width signed integer | Signed representation of full width value |

The layout of the resulting array would be as follows

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Common Value | Signed Integer of same size | The most common value in the array of differences |
| Codepoints | 2 bits per final value | As described in table above |
| Padding | Rounds out the codepoints to a full byte boundary | Zeroed bits |
| Encoded Values |  | The list of encoded values as described in the table above |

For the given sample, this would be the result

    input = [123, 124, 125, 100125, 100125, 100126, 10026]  

    output = [int32(1) 01 00 00 11 01 00 01 XX int8(123) int32(100000) int8(0) int8(0)]

##### Compression of the Buffer

The start of a compressed integer array is an unsigned 64-bit integer
representing the compressed size of the data. This compressed size
defines the number of bytes to read immediately afterward that contains
the compressed data.

Following this is the compressed data of this size that must be
decompressed using the LZ4 algorithm.

| Description     | Size                       | Value                   |
|:----------------|:---------------------------|:------------------------|
| Compressed Size | 8 bytes                    | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Data            | Defined by Compressed Size |                         |

### Preamble

The Crate format has a preamble that must be read prior to parsing the
rest of the file.\
The preamble contains information about the file version, and
information on how to parse the prim hierarchy.

#### Header

Every Crate file starts with a format and version identifier.\
Crate files must start with the `PXR-USDC` format identifier, followed
by the version identifiers.

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| File type identifier | 8 bytes | String of value: `PXR-USDC` Hex of value: `5058522D55534443` |
| Major Version | 1 byte | Unsigned 8 bit integer |
| Minor Version | 1 byte | Unsigned 8 bit integer |
| Patch Version | 1 byte | Unsigned 8 bit integer |
| Unused | 5 bytes |  |

The unused bytes are recommended to be zero value bytes, but are not
required to be so currently. They may be used in future versions of the
specification for specific semantic meanings.

#### Crate Versions

At the time of publishing of this specification, there are several known
versions of the Crate document format.

Any implementer of this specification must support the latest crate
version in this specification for reading.

It is recommended, but not required, to use the lowest Crate version
possible when writing a Crate document. This allows maximum
compatibility with runtimes that may not have updated to support newer
format features.

The minimum crate version on write must be `0.8.0`, and the maximum must
be `0.12.0`. Readers do not need to support versions of Crate prior to
the minimum version, and this specification does not include
specification for those prior versions.

The document will make note of features below that require crate
versions newer than this minimum version.

This table includes information about the changes in each Crate version,
including those prior to the minimum version.

| Version | Description |
|:---|:---|
| 0.12.0 | Added support for Splines |
| 0.11.0 | Added support for Relocates in Layer Metadata |
| 0.10.0 | Added support for Path Expression value types |
| 0.9.0 | Added support for TimeCode and TimeCode Array value types |
| **0.8.0** | Added support for PayloadListOp values and Payload values with layer offsets |
| 0.7.0 | Array sizes are written as 64 bit integers |
| 0.6.0 | Supports compressed (scalar) floating point arrays that are either all ints or can be represented efficiently with a lookup table |
| 0.5.0 | Compressed (u)int and (u)int64 arrays. Arrays no longer store `1` rank. |
| 0.4.0 | Compressed the Table of Contents Sections |
| 0.3.0 | This version has known issues and is ot to be used |
| 0.2.0 | Added support for prepend and append fields in a ListOp |
| 0.1.0 | Fixed structure layout issues encountered on Windows systems |
| 0.0.0 | Initial Release |

#### Bootstrap

Following the header is a bootstrap that gives the location of the table
of contents, and a section of data reserved for future use.

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Table of Contents Offset that must point to a byte offset from the start of the file | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Reserved | 8 bytes |  |

The reserved bytes are recommended to be zero value bytes, but are not
required to be so currently. They may be used in future versions of the
specification for specific semantic meanings.

#### Table of Contents

The table of contents is found at the byte offset provided in the
bootstrap. The Table of Contents must be at the end of the file.

| Description            | Size                 | Value                   |
|:-----------------------|:---------------------|:------------------------|
| Number of Sections     | 8 bytes              | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Repeating Section Data | 32 bytes per Section | See Table below         |

The Table of Contents represents Section listings. Each listing is
defined by the following pattern. Individual listings follow each other
consecutively.

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Name | 16 bytes | ASCII string. Null Terminated |
| Start Offset representing the start of the section from the start of the file | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Size representing the number of bytes to read | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |

The number of sections is variable, but the following are the standard
sections used to populate the data in a common crate layer. Each section
is optional and can be elided if they don’t have data to represent as
long as they’re not also required by another section.

##### Tokens Section

The tokens section defines all the tokens within the file in their
compressed form. It is called `TOKENS` in the Table of Contents.

The section starts with the number of tokens, defined by an unsigned
64-bit integer.\
Following this, are two unsigned 64-bit integers that represent the
uncompressed and compressed size of the data.

Finally, the data is stored in an LZ4 compressed series of bytes, whose
length is defined by the compressed size that was previously specified.

Once uncompressed, the data represents a series of Tokens that must each
be null terminated.

The tokens array must include an item at its first index (0) that is not
referenced by the other sections This can be any string value that you
choose to author, but it is recommended to keep it short.

Each token represents a UTF-8 encoded string.

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Number of Tokens | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Uncompressed size as a number of bytes | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Compressed size as a number of bytes | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Data | Represented by the compressed size | LZ4 Compressed byte array, null delimited and null terminated |

##### Strings Section

The strings section is an array of Indices into the array of tokens read
in the Tokens section. It is called `STRINGS` in the table of contents.
It must be processed after reading the [Tokens
section](#tokens-section).

The first element of the section is the number of indices to be read.
Following that is the contiguous array of Index values of this count.

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Number of Indices | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Data | 4 bytes per Index , times the number of indices |  |

##### Fields Section

The fields section stores a relationship between token names and a Value
Representation as defined in the Value Representations section of the
document below.

The fields section is called `FIELDS` in the table of contents. It must
be processed after reading the [Tokens section](#tokens-section).

The section starts with an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the
number of fields that are encoded.

Following this is a Compressed Integer Array representing an array of
Indices of tokens from the [Tokens section](#tokens-section).

After this, is an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the size of the
compressed value representations.

Finally, this is followed by the compressed data of that size. This data
is compressed using the LZ4 Compression schema above. This data
represents the various value representations.

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Number of Fields | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Compressed Indices | Defined by the Compressed Integer Array algorithm | Compressed Integer Array |
| Data Size | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64-bit integer |
| Value Data | Defined by the Data size |  |

##### Field Sets Section

The Field Sets section stores a grouping of fields that are presented
together. It is called `FIELDSETS` in the Table of Contents.

It must be read after the [Fields section](#fields-section).

The section starts with an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the
number of Indices.

Field Sets are stored in a flat array of Indices into the Fields
section, where groups are terminated by a maximum-value Index
(`4,294,967,295` or `-1` if using unsigned values).

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Number of Fields | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Data | As defined by Compressed Integer Arrays algorithm | Array of Indices |

##### Paths Section

The Paths section stores a list of paths used in the file. It is called
`PATHS` in the Table of Contents. This section depends on the [Tokens
section](#tokens-section) being parsed first.

Each path is stored as a deconstructed set of three arrays with the same
length of items.\
The resulting paths are stored out of order so that they may be
constructed from the results of this array.

The section starts with an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the
total number of paths, followed by three compressed integer arrays of
equal length as described in the subsections below.

The data layout of this section is as follows.

| Description           | Size    | Value                           |
|:----------------------|:--------|:--------------------------------|
| Number of Paths       | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer         |
| Path Indices          |         | Array of Indices                |
| Element Token Indices |         | Array of signed 32-bit integers |
| Jumps                 |         | Array of signed 32-bit integers |

###### Path Indices Array

Following this is the Path Indices array. It is a compressed integer
array of indices that represents the Index of the path.

###### Element Token Index Array

Next is the Element Token Index array, represented as a compressed
integer array of signed 32-bit integers.

The absolute value of the token_index is a lookup into the Tokens index.

The resulting token is added to a parent path using either a prim path
or property path delimiter as per this table

The Element Token Index must never point to the zero index, as different
languages have difficulties delineating between positive and negative
zero. The root element must be a forward slash.

| Type     | Description                                  |
|:---------|:---------------------------------------------|
| Positive | Represents a prim path (**/** delimiter)     |
| Negative | Represents a property path (**.** delimiter) |

###### Jump Array

Finally, there is the Jumps array, represented as a compressed integer
array of signed 32-bit integers.

The construction of the hierarchy of this path is defined by the Jump.
Jump values have significance as described in this table below. This
allows for optimised storage of wide hierarchies which are more common
than very deep hierarchies.

A positive jump represents where to jump to next in the Path Indices and
Element Token Index array to construct the paths of these path
additions.

| Value | Description                                          |
|:------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| `>0`  | An offset to a sibling relative to the current index |
| `0`   | This index only has siblings.                        |
| `-1`  | The index only has a child                           |
| `-2`  | This index is a leaf                                 |

###### Path Construction Algorithm

Paths are constructed from the indices using a recursive algorithm based
on the three arrays defined in this section.

The array is constructed out of order, so it is important to
pre-allocate an output array when starting this algorithm,

The steps to replicate the algorithm are as follows.

Start with a current index `(X)` of 0, to represent the first iteration.
Start with an `empty` Parent Path.

Loop through the following steps, and increment the current index at the
end of each loop.\
Exit the loop if the current path is a leaf path.

1.  If the parent path is empty, set the parent path and current path to
    `/` to represent the absolute root path. If it is not empty then
    1.  Get the paths index from the Path Indices array at X.
    2.  Get the Element Token Index at X to find what Token to lookup
    3.  Use the absolute value of the element token index to look up the
        Tokens array for the new token to add.
    4.  Add the token to the parent path using the path or property
        delimiter according to the positive or negative value of the
        element token index.
2.  Store the resulting path in your output array at the path index
3.  Get the Jump value from the Jump array at X. This value is used to
    check if the path has siblings or children.
4.  If the jump value is a leaf node, stop here.
5.  If the jump value indicates it has siblings (0 or higher), then run
    this algorithm from the start with the starting index as the current
    X plus the jump value.
6.  Set the parent path to the value in the output array at X

##### Specs Section

The Specs section combines data from the previous sections to create a
PrimSpec. The section is called `SPECS` in the Table of Contents.

This section depends on the [Paths section](#paths-section) being parsed
first.

A spec represents the final elements of the document, such that each
element in the document is a combination of:

1.  A Path
2.  A Form
3.  A set of fields that apply to this path

The section starts with an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the
number of specs.

Following this are three compressed integer arrays:

1.  Path indices consisting of Indices into the Path section
2.  Field Set indices consisting of Indices into the Field Sets section
3.  Forms which are a series of unsigned 32-bit integers corresponding
    to the Spec’s Form identifier

Field Set Indices must point to the index of the start of a group within
the flat Field Set section.

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Number of Specs | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64 bit integer |
| Path Indices | As defined by Compressed Integer Arrays algorithm | Array of Indices |
| Field Set Indices | As defined by Compressed Integer Arrays algorithm | Array of Indices |
| Forms | As defined by Compressed Integer Arrays algorithm | Array of unsigned 32-bit integers |

The normative spec forms are described in the following table.

| Value | Form                  | Description                             |
|:------|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| 0     | Unknown               | An unknown Form                         |
| 1     | Attribute             | Attributes under a Prim Spec            |
| 6     | Prim                  | A Prim Specifier                        |
| 7     | [Layer](#layer-specs) | Holder of layer specific fields         |

| 10    | Variant               | A specific variant within a Variant Set |
| 11    | VariantSet            | A group of variants                     |

Unknown spec forms may be processed by the implementation, but are
inert.

An additional set of spec forms are considered non-normative, and are
present for compatibility purposes with older crate files. Binary file
format parsers should be able to consume the specifier but may ignore
any semantics around it. These compatibility spec forms are described in
the following table.

| Value | Form | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 2 | Connection | Connections between Rel attributes |
| 3 | Expression | Scripted Expressions or named Plugin expressions.**Internal to Pixar.** |
| 4 | Mapper | Used to modify the value flowing through a connection. **Internal to Pixar.** |
| 5 | MapperArg | Arguments for a Mapper. **Internal to Pixar.** |
| 9 | RelationshipTarget | A target for a relationship |

### Value Representations

The Crate format stores value representations as data blobs that are
read on demand. This allows large USD scenes to be read quickly by
deferring data reads.

Value representations are stored as unsigned 64-bit integers with
specific significant bytes.

The first 6 bytes are reserved for the Payload of the value
representation.

The penultimate byte represents the value representations type,
enumerated in the [Value Types](#value-types) type table.

The last byte acts as bit flags to represent characteristics of the
type.

| Description | Size    | Value                                      |
|:------------|:--------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Payload     | 6 bytes |                                            |
| Type        | 1 byte  | The type this value represents.            |
| Bit Flags   | 1 byte  | Flags describing this value representation |

The possible bit masks are

| Description         | Value               |
|:--------------------|:--------------------|
| Value is an Array   | The last bit        |
| Value is Inlined    | The second last bit |
| Value is Compressed | The third last bit  |

The Array and Compressed bit flags may be combined.

#### Inlined Value Representation

A Value that has the Inlined bit flag set, is stored directly in the
Payload of the Value representation. There are a few rules to the
encoding of inlined values:

- Only the first 4 bytes of the payload may be used to encode data.

- Inlined values cannot be arrays or be compressed.

- If the payload is zero/null, then the value is implicitly an empty
  constructed or zero valued form of the value type.

- If the value(s) type is a floating precision data type, and if the
  type cannot fit in the 4 byte limit, it is only inlined if the value
  can be encoded as a signed 8-bit integer. e.g. `Vec2h` can fit in 4
  bytes so stores the half-precision floating values directly in the
  inlined value, but `Vec3h` cannot fit, so can only inline values that
  are representable as signed 8-bit integers.

- The payload is parsed differently based on the dimensionality of the
  type.

  | Description | Value |
  |:---|:---|
  | Single dimension (e.g Integers, Floats) | Directly cast to the type |
  | Two Dimensions (e.g Vec2i) | Stored as contiguous values that convert to the given type |
  | Three Dimensions (e.g Matrix3D) | Stored as the top-left to bottom-right diagonal values of the given type E.g 1 - - - 1 - - - 1 |

The following Value types must always be inlined:

- bool
- uchar
- int
- uint
- half
- float
- Variability
- ValueBlock
- AnimationBlock
- string (by index)
- token (by index)
- ObjectPath (by index)
- asset (by index)

The following value types may be inlined by a crate writer, and must be
supported by readers:

- double (if the value is identical when cast to float)
- int64 (if the value is in range of int32)
- uint64 (if the value is in range of uint32)
- matrixXd (if diagonal and diagonal elements are exactly represented
  when cast to int8_t)
- dictionary (if empty)

#### Offset Value Representation

If a value representation is neither an Array nor Inlined, it is an
offset representation. The payload acts as an offset of bytes from the
beginning of the document to data that can be parsed into the specific
value type being represented.

#### Array Value Representations

Array value representations have the array bit flag set. They may
optionally also have the compressed bit flag set.

If the payload is zero, the array is considered empty. Otherwise, the
value will represent the byte offset from the start of the document.

The data at the offset will start with an unsigned 64-bit integer,
representing the number of elements in the array, followed by the data.

An array value can be parsed in multiple ways depending on the payload
and the compression bit.

| Situation | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Payload is 0 | The array is empty |
| Uncompressed | Data is stored as a contiguous array of the type specified |
| Compressed | Array compression will vary based on the type of the value representation. |

Arrays that are 16 bytes or smaller should not be compressed.

Only arrays that have simple data type representations per element may
be compressed. e.g. Integers and Indices may be compressed, but
Quaternions and Matrices may not.

##### Compressed Integral Arrays

Compressed Integral arrays are stored using the compressed integer array
algorithm.

##### Compressed Floating Point Arrays

Compressed float arrays start with an 8-bit character representing the
array encoding scheme.

Integer arrays are used when all the floats can be represented as
integers.

| Encoding Character | Value                                       |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| i                  | Uses the compressed integer array algorithm |
| t                  | Uses a lookup table (described below)       |

The size of the lookup table (LUT) is an unsigned 32-bit integer.\
This is followed by a contiguous Value array of the given type.\
Finally, a compressed array of integers representing the Indices.

The Indices point to values in the Value array. This allows for the
de-duplication of values.

| Description | Size                      | Value                   |
|:------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------|
| LUT Count   | 4 bytes                   | Unsigned 32 bit integer |
| LUT Values  | LUT Count \* size of type |                         |
| LUT Indices | LUT Count \* Index size   |                         |

### Value Types

#### Type Table

A table enumerating the USD value types, with their respective IDs.
These map to the types in the [Foundational Data Types
section](#foundational-data-types).

Specific types are called out below in regard to how to parse them.

#### bool

A boolean binary value, where any non-zero value is considered True.\
Booleans are 8-bit values.

#### uchar

An unsigned, 8-bit character.

#### int

A signed 32-bit integer.

#### uint

An unsigned 32-bit integer.

#### int64

A signed 64-bit integer. When inlined it is represented as an Int.

#### uint64

An unsigned 64-bit integer. When inlined, it is represented as a UInt

#### half

A 16-bit floating point number.\
Since many languages lack a standard representation of a half, USD uses
the [Imath based Half
implementation](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath).

This Half implementations follows the conventions of other floating
point numbers but uses reduced bit range for the exponent and
significand.

The first bit is the sign-bit, denoting whether it is positive or
negative.\
The next 5-bits are the exponent.\
The remaining 10-bits are the significand

| Description | Size    |
|:------------|:--------|
| Sign        | 1 bit   |
| Exponent    | 5 bits  |
| Significand | 10 bits |

As with other floating point numerical types, there are standard
conventions per the IEEE-754 specification. They are described here for
convenience.

If the Sign bit is 0, it is positive. If it is 1, it is negative.

If the exponent is 31, the number is considered as either Infinity or
Not a Number (NaN).\
If the exponent is between 1 and 30, the half is a normalized number.\
If the exponent is 0 but the significand is not 0, it is a denormalized
number.\
If the exponent and significant are both zero, then the resulting value
is zero.

#### float

A 32-bit float.

#### double

A 64-bit floating point number. When inlined , it is represented as a
float.

#### string

Strings are stored in the file as an Index to a token in the Strings
section.

#### token

Tokens are stored in the file as an Index to a token in the Token
section.

#### asset

Assets are stored in the file as an Index to the String section.
However, when inlined, they point to an index in the Token section.

#### Path Expression

**Path Expression support was introduced with Crate version 0.10.0 .**

Path Expressions have the same representation as an AssetPath.

#### Relocates

Relocates are stored as a dictionary of key, value pairs of AssetPaths.

**Relocates support was introduced with Crate version 0.11.0 .**

The first element is a 64-bit unsigned integer to designate the size of
the dictionary.\
Following this are a series of Indices into the Paths section,
alternating between related keys and values.

| Description   | Size    | Value                   |
|:--------------|:--------|:------------------------|
| Element Count | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64-bit Integer |
| Key           | 4 bytes | Path Index              |
| Value         | 4 bytes | Path Index              |

#### ValueBlock

ValueBlocks a sentinel type that indicates that a value is authored but
is specifically set to no value. As such, ValueBlocks have no data
bytes.

Value Blocks may not be stored inside an array.

#### Value

A Value is an indirect pointer to another value somewhere else in the
file.\
It is represented by an unsigned 64-bit integer offset which points to a
Value Representation at the given offset from the start of the file.

It is important to guard against recursion here so that pointers don’t
create an infinite loop. If recursion is detected, an empty value can be
returned.

A Value may not be stored inside an array

#### UnregisteredValue

A representation of metadata fields that are not registered with the
system.

An unregistered value starts with a signed 64-bit integer as an offset
from its current position. This new position points to a Value.

The Value can only point to the following other value types:

- Strings
- Dictionaries
- UnregisteredValueListOps

Unregistered Values may not be stored within an array.

#### Dictionary

A Dictionary is a `key:value` map of data, where the Key must be a
Token.

The Value Representation starts with an unsigned 64-bit integer
representing the number of elements in the dictionary.

Following the count are each key:value stored consecutively.

Keys are stored as an Index to the Token section of the document.\
Values are stored as a 64-bit signed integer representing the offset
from the current

Dictionaries may not be stored in an array.

An empty dictionary is represented implicitly as one that is inlined.

| Description   | Size    | Value                   |
|:--------------|:--------|:------------------------|
| Element Count | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64-bit Integer |
| Key           | 4 bytes | Index                   |
| Value Offset  | 8 bytes | Signed 64-bit Integer   |

#### Layer Offset

Layer Offsets are represented by two 8-byte Doubles.

The first Double represents the time offset to be used.\
The second Double represents the Scale.

| Description | Size    | Value  |
|:------------|:--------|:-------|
| Time Offset | 8 bytes | Double |
| Scale       | 8 bytes | Double |

#### References and Payloads

References are stored as four consecutive fields. Payloads are a form of
reference but are otherwise identical.

The first field is the asset layer path, represented by an Index to an
asset path in the Strings section. An empty string represents an
internal reference.

The second field is an Index into the Paths section, representing the
Prim to use. If no prim is specified, then this uses the default prim
per the composition engine.

The third field is 16-bytes for a Layer Offset.

The fourth and final field is a Dictionary for Custom Data , as defined
by the Dictionary type below. This only exists for references and not
for Payloads.

References may not be stored inside an Array.

| Description      | Size     | Value                            |
|:-----------------|:---------|:---------------------------------|
| Asset Layer Path | 4 bytes  | Index                            |
| Prim Path Index  | 4 bytes  | Index                            |
| Layer Offset     | 16 bytes | Layer Offset                     |
| Custom Data      | 8 bytes  | Dictionary (only for References) |

#### Quaternions

Quaternions are represented by four contiguous elements of the given
Quaternion type.\
The first three elements make up the imaginary coefficients. The last
element is the real coefficient.

When displayed to a user (especially when converted to text), the real
coefficient must be displayed in front of the imaginary coefficients.

Quaternions may have the following base floating precision types.

| Quaternion Type | Base Type |
|:----------------|:----------|
| quatd           | Double    |
| quatf           | Float     |
| quath           | Half      |

#### Vectors (Mathematical)

Vectors are dimensioned types a fixed length, contiguous array of a
given type.\
Vectors as a type represent a mathematical vector, and should not be
confused with the Vector Array type described further down in this
section.

The following dimensioned types exist

| Dimensioned Type | Base Type | Count |
|:-----------------|:----------|:------|
| double2          | double    | 2     |
| float2           | float     | 2     |
| half2            | half      | 2     |
| int2             | int       | 2     |
| double3          | double    | 3     |
| float3           | float     | 3     |
| half3            | half      | 3     |
| int3             | int       | 3     |
| double4          | double    | 4     |
| float4           | float     | 4     |
| half4            | half      | 4     |
| int4             | int       | 4     |

#### Matrix

Matrix types are a 2-dimensional array of doubles, of the same size (N)
in both directions.

Matrix types are defined in a contiguous row-major order, such that
`matrix[i][j]` refers to row `i` and column `j`.

Identity Matrix values have all elements zeroed out, except from the top
left (0,0) to bottom right (N,N) which are set to 1.

Matrices are represented as dimensioned types, the following of which
are available

| Dimensioned Type | Dimension | Identity Matrix                 |
|:-----------------|:----------|:--------------------------------|
| matrix2d         | 2 x 2     | 1 0 0 1                         |
| matrix3d         | 3 x 3     | 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1               |
| matrix4d         | 4 x 4     | 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 |

#### List Operations

List Operations, or ListOps, are a Value Representation of an operation
that edits a list of items.

List Operations may not be stored in an array themselves, or inlined.

List Operations allow for the following operations:

- Adding items
- Adding Explicit Items
- Deleting items
- Reordering items
- Appending items
- Prepending Items
- Making Items explicit

The List Operation starts with an 8-bit bitmask header that determines
the operation being performed.

| Description | Size   | Value   |
|:------------|:-------|:--------|
| Header      | 1 byte | Bitmask |

The Header byte stores the following bit masks from least significant to
most significant.\
If only Make Explicit is true, then the list operation can be treated as
being cleared with no elements.

| Shorthand | Description | Bytemask |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Make Explicit | Removes all items and changes the list to be explicit | 0x1 (1 \<\< 0) |
| Add Explicit Items | Fills the list with the items included in this ListOp | 0x2 (1 \<\< 1) |
| Add Items | Adds the items included in this list op | 0x4 (1 \<\< 2) |
| Delete Items | Deletes the items specified in this list op | 0x8 (1 \<\< 3) |
| Reorder Items | Reorder the list based on the item order within this ListOp | 0x10 (1 \<\< 4) |
| Prepend Items | Prepends items from this ListOp to the start | 0x20 (1 \<\< 5) |
| Append Items | Append items from this ListOp to the end | 0x40 (1 \<\< 6) |

Following the header is a series of arrays depending on the bit masks
above in the following order:

1.  Add Explicit Items
2.  Add Items
3.  Prepend Items
4.  Append Items
5.  Delete Items
6.  Reorder Items

Each array starts with an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the
number of elements.\
This is followed by a contiguous array of the ListOps core type, with
that number of elements.

| Description   | Size                            | Value                   |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------|:------------------------|
| Element Count | 8 bytes                         | 64-bit unsigned integer |
| Data          | Element Count \* Core Data Type | Uncompressed elements   |

The following core types are supported within a List Operation Type

| List Operation Type     | Base Type         |
|:------------------------|:------------------|
| TokenListOp             | Token Index       |
| StringListOp            | String Index      |
| PathListOp              | Path              |
| ReferenceListOp         | Reference         |
| PayloadListOp           | Payload           |

#### Vectors (Arrays)

Vectors are variable length arrays of a given type stored contiguously.
They are not to be confused with the mathematical vectors described
further up in this section. Their naming reflects the variable-length
container types in programming languages like C++.

Vectors always start with an unsigned 64-bit integer reflecting the
number of elements it contains, and is followed by a contiguous array of
that data type.

Arrays of Vector Arrays are not permitted.

| Description   | Size                            | Value                   |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------|:------------------------|
| Element Count | 8 bytes                         | 64-bit unsigned integer |
| Data          | Element Count \* Core Data Type | Uncompressed elements   |

The following data types are valid within a Vector

| Vector Type       | Base Type               |
|:------------------|:------------------------|
| PathVector        | Index into Path section |
| TokenVector       | Token Index             |
| DoubleVector      | double                  |
| LayerOffsetVector | Layer Offset            |
| StringVector      | String Index            |

#### Specifier

Specifiers represent the composition specifier of a given Prim. They are
represented as a signed 32-bit integer with the following valid values

| Spec Type | Description                   | Value |
|:----------|:------------------------------|:------|
| Def       | Concretely defining specifier | 0     |
| Over      | Non-defining specifier        | 1     |
| Class     | Abstractly defining specifier | 2     |

#### Permission

Permissions are a deprecated field within USD documents, that originally
represented how a layer might refer or express an opinion about a prim.

They are documented here for posterity, but are otherwise not required
to be supported. They must not be authored into new USD files.

Permissions are represented as a signed 32-bit integer, and cannot be
stored in an array.

| Permission Type | Value |
|:----------------|:------|
| Public          | 0     |
| Private         | 1     |

#### Variability

Variability is represented by a signed 32-bit integer with the following
valid values, and may not be stored in an array.

Refer to the
[Variability](#variability-enumvariability-specialized-type) section for
information about the values.

| Variability Type | Value |
|:-----------------|:------|
| Varying          | 0     |
| Uniform          | 1     |

#### Variant Selection Map

Variant Selection Maps are a key:value map. The key is the name of a
Variant Set, and the value is a variant within that Variant Set.

Multiple entries within the map can share the same key, as a given
Variant Set may have many variants.

A Variant Selection Map starts with an unsigned 64-bit integer
representing the number of elements.

Following this is a contiguous series of String Index, alternating key
and value.

Variant Selection Maps may not be stored in an array.

| Description   | Size    | Value                   |
|:--------------|:--------|:------------------------|
| Element Count | 8 bytes | 64-bit unsigned integer |
| Key           | 4 bytes | Index                   |
| Value         | 4 bytes | Index                   |

#### Timesamples

Timesamples store a series of time varying Value Representations.\
Timesamples cannot be stored in an array or be inlined.

At the payloads offset, is a 64-bit signed integer that represents the
offset from this current location.

| Description         | Size    | Value                 |
|:--------------------|:--------|:----------------------|
| Offset to Timecodes | 8 bytes | Signed 64-bit Integer |

At this new offset, is a Value Representation of the samples stored as a
DoubleVector.\
Following this, is a signed 64-bit integer that points to an offset from
this point to the values array.

| Description      | Size    | Value                 |
|:-----------------|:--------|:----------------------|
| Offset to Values | 8 bytes | Signed 64-bit Integer |

The values array starts with an unsigned 64-bit integer that represents
the number of elements, and an array of Value Representations.

The TimeCodes and Values are mapped to each other by index.

| Description      | Size                        | Value                 |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------|
| Number of Values | 8 bytes                     | Signed 64-bit Integer |
| Array of Values  | 8 bytes \* Number of Values |                       |

#### TimeCode

TimeCode shares the same representation as a Double.

**TimeCode support was introduced with Crate version 0.9.0 .**

#### Splines

Splines are defined as a series of bytes for the spline data, and an
alternating series of TimeCodes and Dictionary data.

**Spline support was introduced with Crate version 0.12.0 .**

Splines are always stored at the offset value and may not be inlined.

At the offset, we find an unsigned 64-bit integer that tells us how many
bytes of spline data will be there. Following this is a series of bytes
of that count.

| Description | Size       | Value                   |
|:------------|:-----------|:------------------------|
| Byte Count  | 8 bytes    | 64-bit unsigned integer |
| Bytes       | Byte Count | A byte array            |

After this is another unsigned 64-bit integer that tells us how many
custom data items there are. Following this is an alternating couple of
this count, mapping and consisting of TimeCodes and a Dictionary.

| Description       | Size                | Value                   |
|:------------------|:--------------------|:------------------------|
| Custom Data count | 8 bytes             | 64-bit unsigned integer |
| TimeCode          | 8 bytes             | TimeCode double         |
| Dictionary        | Refer to Dictionary | Dictionary              |

Once both are read, the dictionary bytes may be parsed using the
dictionary encoding algorithm.

The first byte is a flag byte with the following bit usage from lowest
to highest.

| Description | Size and Position             |
|:------------|:------------------------------|
| Version     | 4 bits (byte & 0x0F)          |
| Data Type   | 2 bits ((byte & 0x30) \>\> 4) |
| Timed Value | 1 bit (byte & 0x40)           |
| Curve Type  | 1 bit ((byte & 0x80) \>\> 7)  |

Currently, we document version 1 of the splines format.

The Data Type is mapped with

| Value | Description                     |
|:------|:--------------------------------|
| 0     | Unspecified (treated as double) |
| 1     | Double                          |
| 2     | Float                           |
| 3     | Half                            |

Timed value is a boolean.\
Curve Type is a boolean where 0/false indicates that it is a Bézier
curve, and 1/true indicates that it is a Hermite Curve.

Following this flag byte is another flag byte with the following flags

| Description             | Size and Position             |
|:------------------------|:------------------------------|
| Pre Extrapolation Mode  | 3 bits (byte & 0x07)          |
| Post Extrapolation Mode | 3 bits ((byte & 0x18) \>\> 3) |
| Is Looping              | 1 bit (byte & 0x40)           |

The extrapolation modes are mapped with the following values

| Value | Description    |
|:------|:---------------|
| 0     | Block          |
| 1     | Held           |
| 2     | Linear         |
| 3     | Sloped         |
| 4     | Loop Repeat    |
| 5     | Loop Reset     |
| 6     | Loop Oscillate |

If either the pre-extrapolation or post-extrapolation are set to Sloped,
the slope data is stored after this as a double for each.

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Pre Extrapolation Slope | 8 bytes if Pre Extrapolation mode is Slope | Double |
| Post Extrapolation Slope | 8 bytes if Post Extrapolation mode is Slope | Double |

If the Is Looping bit is set, the following loop parameters are encoded
next

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Proto Start | 8 bytes | TimeCode |
| Proto End | 8 bytes | TimeCode |
| Number of Pre Loops | 4 bytes | Positive, unsigned 32-bit integer with a maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer |
| Number of Post Loops | 4 bytes | Positive, unsigned 32-bit integer with a maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer |
| Value Offset | 8 bytes | TimeCode |

##### Knots

If the Data Type is not Unspecified, it is followed by bytes that encode
the knots of the spline.\
To start is an unsigned 32-bit integer that tells us how many knots are
encoded.

Following that is the knot information

| Description | Size    | Value                   |
|:------------|:--------|:------------------------|
| Knot Count  | 4 bytes | Unsigned 32 bit integer |

Each knot is consecutively encoded

| Description | Size   | Value                 |
|:------------|:-------|:----------------------|
| Flag Byte   | 1 byte | Single bit-array byte |

The flag bits are encoded like so from lowest to highest

| Description                  | Size and Position             |
|:-----------------------------|:------------------------------|
| Dual Valued                  | 1 bit (byte & 0x01)           |
| Interpolation Mode           | 2 bits ((byte & 0x06) \>\> 1) |
| Curve Type                   | 1 bit ((byte & 0x08) \>\> 3)  |
| Pre Tangent is in Maya Form  | 1 bit (byte & 0x10)           |
| Post Tangent is in Maya Form | 1 bit (byte & 0x20)           |

Following the flag byte is a sequential set of data

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Time | 8 bytes | TimeCode |
| Value | Variable | The data type of the splines |
| Dual Value | Variable | The data type of the splines. Only encoded if Dual Valued flag bit is true. |
| Pre Tangent Width | 8 bytes | Double if curve type for knot is not Hermite |
| Post Tangent Width | 8 bytes | Double if curve type for knot is not Hermite |
| Pre Tangent Slope | Variable | The data type of the splines |
| Post Tangent Slope | Variable | The data type of the splines |

## Package

USD Packages store USD files and other required media within a
specialized zip compression

### ZIP

USD Packages are encoded according to the ZIP standard with some
caveats.

USDZ normatively references the Zip File Format Specification version
6.3.9 of PKWARE® Inc. USDZ are conforming Zip files as specified by the
document presented here
<https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT>.

A breakdown of the PKZip format is provided by the James Madison
University at
<https://users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip.html> .

#### ZIP Features

USD Packages must be stored without compression and must be stored
without encryption.\
USD Packages must be 32 bit ZIP files and not 64 bit.

#### Contents

A USD Package must use the first file within the Zip file as its root
layer to be read.

The file must be the first entry in the Zip Central Directory, as
described by the PKZip specification.

Additionally, the file must be the first file provided from the
beginning of the Zip file to allow for efficient loading when reading a
zipfile straight-ahead without jumping to the central directory record.

#### Data Layout

USD Packages must be aligned to 64 byte blocks, such that every file
header starts at a multiple of 64 bytes for efficient reading.

#### End of Central Directory record Restrictions

To provide efficient lookup of the zip contents, USDZ restricts the use
of some fields in the End of Central Directory record. This particularly
also speeds up the look-up along a network or remote location where
latency can be very high. By not having to search for the End of Central
Directory record, USDZ can be efficiently read across high latency
boundaries.

Additionally, the End of Central Directory record must be at the very
end of the zip file, with no padding following it.

The final bytes of the file must be as such

| Description | Size | Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Signature | 4 bytes | The standard PKZIP signature of 50 4B 05 06 |
| Disk Number | 2 bytes | A value of zero as USDZ does not support multi disk zips |
| Central Directory Disk Number | 2 bytes | Also, a value of zero |
| Central Disk Entries | 2 bytes | The number of entries in the central directory of this file |
| Total Disk Entries | 2 bytes | The number of entries in the central directory of this file, as there may only be one central directory |
| Central Directory Size | 4 bytes | The size of the central directory in bytes |
| Central Directory Offset | 4 bytes | The offset of the Central directory from the start of the file |
| Comment Length | 2 bytes | This must be zero as no comment is allowed |

The comment length must be the final set of bytes in the file with
nothing after it. This restriction may be loosened in future versions of
the specification.

#### File Types

USDZ files are recommended to only include the following file
types/extensions for maximum portability:

- .usd , .usda , .usdc
- .png , .jpg , .jpeg , .exr, .avif
- .m4a , .mp3 , .wav

You may include other file types, but this will risk the compatibility
of the USDZ package with other runtime that may not support those
formats.

### Validation and Out of Spec USDZ files

Implementations of this specification are not required to validate a
USDZ file when reading from it.\
Implementations may choose to support out of spec USDZ files, or they
may choose to reject it.

For example, if a USDZ file does have a comment, or doesn’t align to the
data layout restrictions, it may be still easily read by a range of zip
libraries.

However, out of spec usdz files are not guaranteed to be portable across
implementations, and implementations must adhere to the USDZ
specification when writing the file.
