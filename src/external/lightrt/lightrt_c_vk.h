/*
 * lightrt_c_vk.h — Vulkan GPU interop for the LightRT C11 triangle kernel.
 *
 * Two directions, both built on Vulkan compute (the loader, lightrt_vkew, opens
 * libvulkan at runtime — there is NO Vulkan SDK header or link-time dependency):
 *
 *   Path A  CPU build -> GPU trace : lrt_vk_trace_scene() uploads a scene built
 *           by lrt_tri_scene_build() and traverses it with a compute shader that
 *           mirrors the scalar CPU kernel, returning identical hits (within fp
 *           tolerance).
 *
 *   Path B  GPU build -> CPU trace : lrt_vk_build_scene() runs the LBVH front
 *           end (centroids + Morton codes) on the GPU, finishes the hierarchy on
 *           the CPU, and returns a heap lrt_tri_scene traversable with the normal
 *           lrt_tri_intersect1() / etc.
 *
 * Everything degrades gracefully: if no Vulkan loader/device is available,
 * lrt_vk_engine_create() returns NULL and the caller falls back to the CPU
 * kernel. An engine is created once and may be reused across calls; a single
 * engine is NOT safe to use from multiple threads concurrently.

 *
 * Each prototype builds as a SINGLE BLAS (this API does no chunk splitting), so a
 * prototype larger than the device's one-BLAS build limit must be pre-split by the
 * caller into several smaller prototypes (each a triangle slice) sharing the same
 * per-instance transform — the encoding is unaffected. Fails (returns NULL,
