# tinysubdiv (tsd)

Clean-room, dependency-free subdivision surface library for TinyUSDZ.
C++17 in a C-ish style: POD input views, no exceptions, no RTTI.

## Features

- Uniform refinement: **Catmull-Clark**, **Loop** (all-triangle input),
  **Bilinear** — numerically verified against OpenSubdiv (`Far::
  TopologyRefiner`/`PrimvarRefiner`) across the full USD feature matrix.
- USD/AOUSD subdivision semantics:
  - `interpolateBoundary`: `edgeAndCorner` (default), `edgeOnly`, `none`
  - `faceVaryingLinearInterpolation`: all 6 modes (`cornersPlus1` default)
  - semi-sharp creases (`creaseIndices`/`creaseLengths`/`creaseSharpnesses`,
    per-crease or per-edge sharpness), `uniform` and `chaikin` creasing
  - corners (`cornerIndices`/`cornerSharpnesses`)
  - face holes (`holeIndices`), propagated and filtered
  - `triangleSubdivisionRule`: `catmullClark` (default), `smooth`
- Primvar refinement: `vertex` (smooth), `varying` (linear), `faceVarying`
  (seam-split smooth or per-corner linear); `uniform` replicates via
  `RefinedMesh::face_source` on the caller side.
- Closed-form limit positions (`SnapToLimit`) and limit normals
  (`ComputeLimitNormals`) for Catmull-Clark and Loop.
- **Streaming refinement** (`RefineStream`): refines to level N without ever
  materializing the full output -- the final (largest) level is emitted to a
  sink in bounded batches, so peak working memory is the level-(N-1) state plus
  one batch (geometry + vertex/varying primvars + linear faceVarying +
  seamless limit normals). With `StreamOptions::block_faces` it also bounds the
  *working set* (block + halo refinement) for meshes too large to refine whole.
  This is what lets deep refinement fit in wasm32's 2 GB; exposed to JS via the
  `SubdivStreamer` binding and demoed in `web/js/subdiv.js`.
- Hardened: full input validation, 64-bit overflow-checked sizing,
  per-level vertex/face/corner caps, fuzz-tested (`tests/fuzzer/fuzz_tsd.cc`).
  Non-manifold input (including inconsistent face winding) is **rejected** —
  an intentional divergence from OpenSubdiv, which tolerates it.
- Optional threading through an injected `parallel_for` callback with
  bit-identical results.

## Testing

- `feat-subdiv` (ctest, always built): analytic rule checks, invariants,
  hardening and determinism tests. No external dependencies.
- `feat-subdiv-verify` (opt-in): exhaustive comparison against an
  OpenSubdiv **source checkout** (no pre-build needed):

```sh
cmake -B build -DTINYUSDZ_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
      -DTINYUSDZ_TSD_VERIFY_WITH_OSD=ON \
      -DOpenSubdiv_ROOT=/path/to/OpenSubdiv
cmake --build build -j --target feat-subdiv-verify
ctest --test-dir build -L osd-verify
```

The comparator is ordering-independent (vertices matched by position on
jittered corpora, faces compared as rotation-canonicalized sets) and checks
positions, topology, fvar values, hole filtering, limit positions and limit
normals. Limit normals at interior creases and infinitely sharp corners are
convention-dependent in OpenSubdiv itself and are checked structurally
(unit length, perpendicularity to the crease) instead of bitwise.
